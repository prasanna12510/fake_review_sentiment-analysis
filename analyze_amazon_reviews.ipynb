It doesn't heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can't even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I've made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays.

The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.</td><td>06 25, 2012</td><td>A5A4374R8I7NB</td><td>PWB Esq</td><td>Works Fine, But It Died On ME</td><td>1340582400</td></tr><tr><td>6073894996</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers.

That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm.

I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length.

Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around.

After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement.

This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.</td><td>02 4, 2005</td><td>A17BUUBOU0598B</td><td>Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"</td><td>A good unit at a great price.

Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the \"skip\" mode as following:\"One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a \"skip\" mode. When a tape player's \"skip\" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it \"hears\" sound again. If your tape player has a \"skip\" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in \"normal\" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to \"fast forward\" over any silent portions of your audio feed.\"This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the \"skip\" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again.

Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple.

The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.</td><td>07 4, 2004</td><td>APGPEJS55U2SF</td><td>Jeffrey Liss</td><td>Great Bluetooth Phone</td><td>1088899200</td></tr><tr><td>B0000AGRYX</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>2.0</td><td>the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.

It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).

The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints.</td><td>04 27, 2011</td><td>A3H3SG8XIXVKXZ</td><td>Science Aardvark</td><td>non-identical twins</td><td>1303862400</td></tr><tr><td>B0000ALPBP</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded.

It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.

Not with this unit.  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.

I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking \"talk me off speaker phone\", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a \"soft phone\" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.

The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane.

I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6.

The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile.

FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really. Another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy.</td><td>07 24, 2004</td><td>A1ACM1CBGORBN1</td><td>Sherry Berry</td><td>Pretty good phone.. an improvement from my v205</td><td>1090627200</td></tr><tr><td>B0000SX3BK</td><td>List(8, 10)</td><td>1.0</td><td>I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone.

The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.

All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are \"Out of Service.\"Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone.

No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings.

I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!

There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.

Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.

The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.

The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.

This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price.

But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</td><td>09 17, 2013</td><td>A1E1LEVQ9VQNK</td><td>J.

The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal.  But that's how it blocks out noise.  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that.  It's sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn't be left in the open to collect dust.  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying.  You feel like you're hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it's a little bit violating...).  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset.  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525.</td><td>11 27, 2007</td><td>A355PZ56RVA77M</td><td>BB</td><td>It Doesn't Fit In The Case  (Without Bending It)</td><td>1196121600</td></tr><tr><td>B0001YX9ZI</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>3.0</td><td>The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised.  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around.  I'm not talking about playing tennis here, I'm talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.</td><td>03 8, 2010</td><td>AT0LAX5LUCP4X</td><td>B.

It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've \"pulled your ear back\" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it's way better for wind noise, I haven't tried that.

I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug.

But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise (you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments).A few nits:They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished.  A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don't include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.

My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well.</td><td>12 9, 2013</td><td>A2F2F7N94SR1KQ</td><td>Razornoodle \"Razornoodle\"</td><td>A very good high quality USB hub</td><td>1386547200</td></tr><tr><td>B000227PL8</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great hub and has been good for several months.

The blue LED at the top is unnecessary to indicate power as there are the other green LEDs for each port. I've used the plugs for keyboards, mice, HDDs and thumb drives. I've never had any problems.Overall it a solid and small hub and recommended if all you need is USB 2.0 and up to 7 plugs.</td><td>04 11, 2014</td><td>A1OPKNO7IXWV27</td><td>R.

But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port \"in person,\" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to \"fatten up\" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest \"gripe\": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the \"cuteness\" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This \"off brand\" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington \"round mound\" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]</td><td>01 17, 2008</td><td>A6FIAB28IS79</td><td>Samuel Chell</td><td>4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.</td><td>1200528000</td></tr><tr><td>B000227PL8</td><td>List(0, 2)</td><td>1.0</td><td>For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub, it's a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance, my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it \"rests\" on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I'm not sure. I like it because it matches my setup, but it's very bright, and I'd rather the \"power\" be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to \"not work\" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting.

For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.</td><td>03 9, 2005</td><td>A14EF1PPKMSEPU</td><td>E.

I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.

I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this \"Universal\" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with \"Noise Cancelling.\"  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.

Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying \"headset signal weak - switch to handset?\"The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is \"connected\" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant \"crackling\" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just \"disconnect\" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The \"hanging\" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.

I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room.

I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.</td><td>04 1, 2006</td><td>A3IAAVB63OE76I</td><td>T.

I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed.

There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a \"good\" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks.

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open, it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist, this is fine. But I'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating.

I stick these under the \"wings\" and that solves the problem.Here's where I got the latest driver released for the device (it's no longer supported by iGO):[...]This driver is for Windows Mobile 5, but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device. :)You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card.

It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it.

They don't work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a \"universal\" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit.

Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called \"smart phones\" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.</td><td>04 11, 2011</td><td>A3VAROHXBXV0I2</td><td>M.

This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard, with the same spring to the keys, quality, durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able, however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain, due to the fact that a) you have to use \"custom\" key commands using ctrl, fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer, you \"already know\" the \"motion\" for & or * or (), and you'll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect, on this keyboard)That said, entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard, just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it. You will get used to it, just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow, this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages, etc. I mean no more \"click-click-click, clack-clack, click-click-click-click, clack-clack\" to type out a single four-letter word. Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts, pants, etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent. I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes, as I can type far faster (and more legibly) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum (like my old minidisc player) and the detachable device stand is sweet! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class, and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow, is this thing essential? I mean, I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in, say, a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well.

A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate, in small letters, that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case, though, back it goes, which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.

Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard.

After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.

Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.</td><td>04 18, 2014</td><td>AVPNQUVZWMDSX</td><td>esanta \"esanta\"</td><td>Not bad, but stick to the original</td><td>1397779200</td></tr><tr><td>B0002SYC5O</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>3.0</td><td>I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone.

No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad.

Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don't know if this is by design or just accident.

I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130.

The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250.

I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise, it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent, probably 3+ days, although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great, sometimes 10 ft causes annoying \"I am about to disconnect\" noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything, it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing, last-number redial, etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally, the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone, look for something else.

I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.

T-Zones service is an inexpensive way to gain access to your POP3 email accounts. It has a keyboard. You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus, the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it's perfectly symmetrical, you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all.</td><td>02 17, 2005</td><td>A1KE06KXZCYVWG</td><td>L.

Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to \"press 1 for English\", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter \"A\" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.

You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.</td><td>10 6, 2004</td><td>A5JLAU2ARJ0BO</td><td>Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"</td><td>It's the service, stupid</td><td>1097020800</td></tr><tr><td>B00063DKVC</td><td>List(6, 9)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice.

For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.

The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are \"OK\" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates.

They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, \"With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?\" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called \"screen\" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, \"[IMAGE]\", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.</td><td>12 13, 2004</td><td>A1N03V52IRZ5PR</td><td>N.

I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 \"real\" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few \"doodle type\" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the \"hinge\" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old \"blue versions\" of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new \"black face\" ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the \"flash\" when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, \"that thing is huge!\"..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.

This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so.

For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode \"sleep\". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there.

The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me, I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.  Works great for me!If you are considering a headset, get this one.  It's what bluetooth technology should be like.  It's so great that Amazon sold out...  nice.

It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed, the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only, otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all, installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage, I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones.

I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to \"get off your crappy Jabra BT headset\" or \"take me off your Motorola BT headset\".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a \"correct\" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.

This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building, so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in, either Intercom or from an external line, there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted, allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done, I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly, I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit.

Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable.

Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius, I'd have stuck with the i500. In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let's talk about the positives of the 650:Camera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on \"write on screen\" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  \"Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2\" and it does.  \"Call Bob Tompson Mobile\" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)So, it's okay, I'm okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there's really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat... But there is none, so, with that said, the Treo 650 is okay.  More steps back, a few steps forward, but no other choiuce.</td><td>08 27, 2005</td><td>A12EVK82QUTSA6</td><td>Allen C.

It is a dramatic improvement and I love it.The screen is now high res and looks incredibly clear, the Bluetooth works wonderfully with the wireless Jabra headset. When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.  The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I wouldn't even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available.</td><td>11 26, 2004</td><td>A245BG7SCVXDJB</td><td>DaveT \"davet\"</td><td>A must get upgrade to the Treo 600!</td><td>1101427200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006FLA80</td><td>List(28, 29)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I am not too picky when it comes to a PDA phone, if I can keep my outlook calendar, appointment, and call the contact store on it, I'm happy! But I do wish the Treo 600 can be better!I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that's because Parts of my prayer has been answered: A better screen resolution; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600, I use my finger instead of the stylus now; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time; my favorite bluetooth is built-in. And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.However, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed. And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650, as to all my handheld gadgets, I bought a fitted case to protect it. If you like me want to keep everything in perfectly nice looking condition, I recommad a case and a screen protector. Remember, this is a hefty investment comparable to a PC, this Treo 650 may even be your home phone, make sure it is well-protected.</td><td>12 21, 2004</td><td>AWHYWCU687LSJ</td><td>D.

At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a \"free return and repair,\" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?

I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought \"they aren't ready yet.\"  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you'd go for a week between recharges!It's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you'll be faster.From what I've seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.

If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.

But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you're lucky).  It is designed to work primarily for mobile phones only.</td><td>12 8, 2006</td><td>A1VL6XFRL2NALY</td><td>Tony P \"Tons\"</td><td>Crackling issues, but integrates well with many devices</td><td>1165536000</td></tr><tr><td>B0006HP7NC</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect for my Contour Roam GPS camera.

Given its low price, though, it's a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very \"floppy\" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced \"speakerphone\" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE. You must leave the H500 turned on and actively connected to your phone in order to use it, just like any other headset.</td><td>11 10, 2005</td><td>AXMVY1CH5125B</td><td>Dr. Sam Beckett \"Hoping for that last leap home\"</td><td>Successor to the HS820, but could be better.</td><td>1131580800</td></tr><tr><td>B0006HTZ80</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>1.0</td><td>I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500.

I do my research, ad nauseum, before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider. I've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730. Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected.  But like I said, I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service.  Got the phones from Amazon.I, too, was taken by the looks of the RAZR, and so was my wife once she saw one.  But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for?  For one, Nextel wasn't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service.  (Plus, the price for an \"upgrade phone\" for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren't worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it's silly.  You can assign and create \"categories\"  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I've researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I'm happy with the material and it's expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it's made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it's nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn't the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It's expensive because it's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don't be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it's not working out for me.  So there's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.

But there is no improvement on any of the calling features.So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it, else it is not worth the $200.</td><td>10 15, 2005</td><td>AYT67DOBF4BR2</td><td>Aravind Babu \"aravind_babu\"</td><td>Nothing extraordinary, mainly a lot of hype around the looks</td><td>1129334400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(37, 38)</td><td>3.0</td><td>I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the \"MORE\" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the \"audio sweet spot\" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? \"Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.\"4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet\". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.</td><td>08 27, 2005</td><td>A39KJOCZGCM8P1</td><td>Chris Lee Mullins</td><td>Great looking phone....if yer into that sort of thing</td><td>1125100800</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(26, 27)</td><td>3.0</td><td>The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size.</td><td>04 12, 2005</td><td>A2QKACZB3SVNVO</td><td>C N</td><td>WARNING - ROTTEN BATTERY LIFE!

I just spent all that money on a super exclusive cool phone, and they make me buy software for $30? That's actually kind of crazy.They also messed up on the phone book. 450 Outlook contacts, that were spawned from 200 core contacts - each cell phone, business, email, and home entry for an individual is a separate entry. Way way too unwieldy. They need to update this error big time. They've also missed on priority numbers - you know, you identify people you call a lot, and they go to the head of the list. I'm used to the problems now, but wow what a miss on their part.The camera, oh it takes pictures. They look decent on the cell phone, but forget much more. The shutter speed must be very slow, you have to hold the phone solid to not get blurry pictures (when viewed on a computer screen full size) - on the phone they look great.Overall - my nits are truely nits, this is one heck of a great phone. If you're price sensitive, buy the V500 series. If you want cool, get this one.By the way, I'm a long time ATT customer and had no trouble (read it took less than 10 minutes to buy and activate this phone) with Cingular.

I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn't even read what the problem was before they \"fix\" it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar \"basic\" cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won't waste my time.

Superior and striking good looks and is solidly built - no, it does not look cheap as some previous reviewer stated. I live in GA and Cingular reception is very good. Paired my v3 with Bluetrek G2 bluetooth headset(received rave reviews and is cheap - pick one up on ebay) and I wonder what took me so long to get on board.

CHECK. Innovative construction... CHECK. Exclusive price tag... CHECK. In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It's their way of saying, &#34;We're known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola's part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend's V551.Mikey's likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.</td><td>11 21, 2004</td><td>A3JMO0ET6611HV</td><td>M.D. \"mdoan300\"</td><td>The Ferrari of Mobile Phones</td><td>1100995200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've had this phone for a while now and here's what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it's not as intuitive as say, Nokia's interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to \"Shortcuts\" and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone's memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook's address book, so I'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.

The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random \"sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little \"M\" circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well...horrible. And last but not least, the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception.

Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a \"shared plan\" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your \"Cell phone Numbers\" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a \"single 700 rollover mins shared plan\" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to \"My Account\" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular \"in my area\" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away \"With NO ROAMING charges\" btw our last cell phone service \"Alltel\" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in \"Speaker Phone\" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call \"Mobile to Mobile\".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it \"needs\" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the \"address book being slow\" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by \"Name\" or \"Speed dial #\" or \"Voice name\" or even by \"Email\" and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for \"Voice command\" it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for \"list only\" \"no picture\" and by \"primary number only\", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in \"Categories\" such as \"Business/Personal/General/VIPs\"Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have \"primary number only\" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to \"Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers\" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about \"ear piece volume too low\"  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the \"volume\" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the \"top edge of the phone\", too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose \"PHONE\" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under \"sunlight\" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.</td><td>10 7, 2005</td><td>AVK9BSXJJ51I8</td><td>S.

The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone.</td><td>10 30, 2006</td><td>ANF5BP1SD3Z3O</td><td>Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01</td><td>Razr V3 works great for me.</td><td>1162166400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2G3U</td><td>List(9, 11)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful.

I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.</td><td>09 5, 2005</td><td>A35IX2GE0VC0JP</td><td>FirePepper Red \"firepepper red\"</td><td>Excellent Phone</td><td>1125878400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2G3U</td><td>List(17, 18)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.</td><td>04 26, 2005</td><td>A2ZZGWC4FUGJAE</td><td>M.

There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone.

Oh</td><td>Frustrating flaws make for painful ownership</td><td>1119225600</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2G3U</td><td>List(32, 34)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Bottom LineStrongly recommended.  This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it \"learns\" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software.</td><td>05 27, 2005</td><td>A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y</td><td>Steven Metz</td><td>I'm Very Pleased</td><td>1117152000</td></tr><tr><td>B0006J419Q</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I didn't like it but my husband seems to think that it works great for him and uses it often.</td><td>01 8, 2013</td><td>A38X2R3BOQGQZQ</td><td>B.

The buds have bass ports and the mic capsule is a reasonable size.

Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.</td><td>04 9, 2006</td><td>A35IX2GE0VC0JP</td><td>FirePepper Red \"firepepper red\"</td><td>Good  headset but has its flaws</td><td>1144540800</td></tr><tr><td>B0007IOMOU</td><td>List(6, 6)</td><td>4.0</td><td>The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them.

I got so frustrated, I was about to throw this thing out of the window.  For a product that use regular batteries, the battery door is the most difficult to open.  Once opened, you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out.  The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug.  This must be a sick joke by Motorola.  Forget about changing the battery on the go, you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience.

It seems like they have now added one picture in which you can kind of see it from the side. This is no a problem, it holds well, but a magnet might have been nice.The only real drawbacks are that when you keep the cover closed for a while, it may leave small horizontal smudge marks on the phone from the card pockets.

I have to say that so far this is the best case that I have tried out from Box Wave. It slipped on very snug and was even harder to get off. Although it is not impossible to get off it is difficult which is a good thing in my book. This case is very comfortable in the hand and just feels right. All controls were easily accessed and everything on my Galaxy Note 2 worked fine with the case on it. The only thing I didn't like was that this does not come with a holster. I like to use holsters and carry my phone on my belt. Well I did manage to find a holster from one of my earlier purchases for my phone and it fit the Box Wave like a glove. It was from one of those 2 piece rubber and hard plastic cases that Amazon sells for about $7.00. I can't remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster. I have had the chance to locate the name of the case and holster and it is from \"Rhino\" brand. The ones I have were \"Black Rhino\". I hated the cases but the holster is a perfect fit for this Box Wave case.</td><td>08 20, 2013</td><td>A3BTNXS43GTZDS</td><td>David E.

There's a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn't know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there's anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it's because they're cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It's perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there's no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that's a huge mistake.  If you've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you've ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you've seen the dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won't turn on or off, or can't have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don't realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there's still the electromechanical HOME key that's uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it's a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I'll bet, don't know about, and that's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It's really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren't like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass's edge all-'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table's surface.Well, the Note II's glass is actually higher up (when it's lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case's bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it's the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II's screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK \"3D\" screen protector for the Note II) that's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and \"hang\" down over it, so to speak, to make the protector's edge come closer to the case's bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that's fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK \"3D\" style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn't touch because it's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge \"respects\" the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and doesn't try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II's glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn't show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called \"s-style\" or \"s-series\" TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that's on those \"s\" cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those \"s\" series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn't work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those \"s\" style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it's worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a \"3D\" type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II's screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L.

This is the same case but with a uniform glossy texture.  I had a Boxwave case for my Note I and it was great.  This new case is even better.  It is thinner and more streamlined, and the buttons work even better.  This doesn't have cutouts for the buttons, instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone's buttons.  I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage.  Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately. Lastly, this case is made from TPU, which is the best case material in my opinion.  It's firmer so it stays on the phone better than the soft silicone cases and does not pick up lint or stick to your pocket, while still offering some cushion when you drop it.</td><td>12 13, 2012</td><td>A2E9SRCRO6XLJI</td><td>Kevin</td><td>very nice</td><td>1355356800</td></tr><tr><td>B0007MAOOS</td><td>List(4, 4)</td><td>2.0</td><td>I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone.

Even before installing the screen protectors, I knew it was good quality just from the feel in the hand. These protectors are more of a second screen rather than just a sheet of a plastic.Like all protectors they can be tricky to install, so be sure to read the instructions on the back of the package. After reading the instructions they go on like a piece of cake. The first step is to clean the screen with the enclosed lint free cloth. I find it best to position the screen around the camera and sensor first.While applying the screen protector use the smoothing card (squeegee) to firmly affix it to the screen. There may be some small air bubbles, they will disappear within a day or two. Once all of these steps you have completed, you will have a phone screen that will safely protected.These screen protectors are step above the rest because of their special features. Which are: anti-fingerprint; scratch resistant; anti-bubble; super clear; oil-resistant. This lets me know they have the customer in mind.The best part of this kit beside the great screen protector, is the smoothing card (squeegee) that is made out of plastic and not cardboard like the other cheap ones on the market.CONTENTS:Illumishield Screen Protectors (3x)Smoothing CardLint-Free Polishing ClothInstructions (Back Of Package)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</td><td>03 10, 2014</td><td>A18U49406IPPIJ</td><td>Deon</td><td>Great Way To Protect Your Note 2</td><td>1394409600</td></tr><tr><td>B00C80S4W6</td><td>List(2, 2)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Very,very well made.

The measured capacity should meet or exceed the claimed capacity.These are my results.IEC standard battery capacity test:Five Hour Discharge Test:  Capacity=2.218 Ah (96.4% rated), Energy=8.256 Wh.Five Hour Discharge Test:  Capacity=2.213 Ah (96.2% rated), Energy=8.233 Wh.With so many other batteries that are 2600mAh, and actually provide that, buying these doesn't make sense, and I recommend avoiding these.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------It isn't the first time I've seen this type of thing before, but it's definitely been taken to the next level.  Scam products like these will have a number of 5 star shill reviews, but the accounts will have only one review, and they aren't verified purchases.  Sometimes, they will be verified purchases and the account will only have one product reviewed total.  It becomes fairly obvious that they're fake reviews.  This battery is full of fake reviews that are much more advanced.These 5 star reviews all have the same funny smell with such smarmy statements as \"Cheap price, great product\" \"Will buy more again\" \"try getting this cheap at a store\" \"Just as advertised\" \"my honest review\" \"I love the product and I love the service even more!!\" \"Very promising product\" and so on.  This one such review tries to cover up the very nature of the scam: \"I would say they are the same as the original.\" - which these are clearly not.  The cookie cutter nature becomes obvious when so many reviews use the same recipe.More than 75% of these positive reviews are shill reviews.  At first glance, it appears the accounts are normal user accounts since they have a timeline of other purchases mixed in with the shilling.  On second glance, I notice that all the smarmy reviews have 5 or so other MaxBoost products reviewed with 5 star ratings all at the same time.  There's no crime in reviewing all of a company's products, but it's suspicious when nearly every positive reviewer has also positively reviewed the exact same 5 or so products!  It's clear that MaxBoost has gone to the next level: employees or family members or maybe people paid to write the reviews have taken a part in buying a number of the same products, and giving them the same generic five star reviews.However wrong, one or two such reviews may be useful to get a first review up to \"put the product on the map.\"  What's happening here is a cover up of the scam battery's true nature: an inferior product.  In this case, there are a number of honest manufacturers selling better versions of the same product:Anker 2 x 2600mAh Samsung Galaxy S4Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 2 x 2600mAh NFCOnite 2x 2600mAh Li-ion Battery(Onite isn't trustworthy, but this battery is OK)There's more, like the immediate downvoting of revealing reviews, but I'll save that for another time.  Please note that I have no association with any battery company, or any related company, and I have no family or friends that do either.  My goal is to provide the battery tests people would do themselves if they could.  I test batteries that I buy with my spare money in my spare time in order to give you scientific and objective analysis that can be used alongside or in place of my included insight.  The time spent with such products and familiarity with the manufacturers' tactics are a result of my reviewing.  This all started by getting scammed when I bought a QCell battery.</td><td>07 23, 2013</td><td>A64S8V75ITLFG</td><td>longcat</td><td>MaxBoost 2300mAh is less than stock 2600mAh, and isn't 2300mAh</td><td>1374537600</td></tr><tr><td>B00C83SZ86</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>1.0</td><td>These these batteries do not hold the charge very long at all.

At the end you will see my original review but please note my edit.I have been using these batteries for just a year now and the batteries are now unreliable.  They are used in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  About two months ago I noticed that my phone would suddenly reboot.  Sometimes it would happen just once, but sometimes it would continue to reboot until either the battery drained completely or I took the battery out.  This does not happen with my original battery that came with the phone, only with these two.I also have noticed that the batteries can be 90% full one minute and then just a few minutes later can be half drained.  I did a reset to both of them by draining them completely and then charging them fully overnight in the charger but that did not solve the problem.I also noticed that they never charge to 100% any more either, they only get to 98%.Overall I have been happy with these but they clearly have reached their limits and I am replacing them with a different brand to try.  They always fit perfectly, no problem there, and they lasted about a year.Another important not for people to know is that the external charger they come with takes about 8 hours to charge one battery.  I think slow charging is better for a battery's life though.Original review:Love it, had these almost a year now, still using them.  Each battery gives me many many hours of continuous use.  I just keep them rotating in the charger and take all with me when I am out of the house all day and never am without power.</td><td>12 11, 2013</td><td>A3C46B2H1XC2HM</td><td>Skinny Jay</td><td>A Skinny Jay Review!!!</td><td>1386720000</td></tr><tr><td>B00C83SZ86</td><td>List(11, 13)</td><td>3.0</td><td>The good news is that you get two batteries and a charger for low cost.

But the first battery, after being fully charged overnight, lost 2% by sitting and then lost another 12% in the 30 mins that I used it.  The OEM battery drains much more slowly.  Perhaps it's a QC issue with the batteries. Another review mentioned that a battery they received from Maxboost lasted LONGER than the one that came with the phone.  Since Maxboost reads these posts, perhaps they have insight into why this might be the case?</td><td>06 6, 2013</td><td>AAJOV2S9O7OO</td><td>Torrey Pines</td><td>Not impressed</td><td>1370476800</td></tr><tr><td>B00C842Z04</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>2.0</td><td>might as well coat your phone with clear silicone RTV, it looks and feels about the same.

I initially bought it for rear and then installed front as it was very easy and bubble free.Pros: Nice packaging and the squueze is much better then other companies.Pros: Much less finger prints. No need to wipe frequently.Cons: If you squeeze harder it will sag the screen.

As it is self healing as advertised, i waited next 24 hours but waves didnt go away. PLease check my uploaded images.Cons: I used flip case foir htc one. After couple hours i see the flip case closure left marks on the screen which healed in few hours. But every time open the case, i will see the marks.It is very easy to get deformed.Cons: On the website they advertise as glass  like , but it is nothing that sort of.

The Galaxy S4 is about 8mm deep. With this case, it's 11mm, largely because it has a surprisingly thick lip that extends out from the screen almost 2mm. Great for protection, but needlessly large and you end up hitting it whenever you use the capacitive buttons on the bottom of the phone.Second, the material feels like what they make trash cans out of, so not a pleasant tactile experience relative to the bare S4.Third, the button covers make it much more difficult to press the volume and power buttons. This might be fixable if you carved out the covers with a hobby knife. As is, it makes the phone truly unpleasant to use.Fourth, it's not perfectly snug around the sides. When you're busily trying to cram the power down, you can feel the side pieces flexing. Looking at the phone from an angle, the front lip doesn't actually rest on the screen.

It is a genuine LG battery, identical to the LG battery that came with my LG Venice (the same LG battery is used in the LG Splendor, Showtime and the LG L7).The OEM BL-44JH battery from Orion Gadgets was stamped with a LG factory \"fresh date\" that was less than six months old...a MUCH newer battery than I have received in the past from other Amazon vendors.However, the battery was DOA, totally dead on arrival, with a zero charge level.  A properly stored phone battery should be shipped with a charge of 30% to 50%, which ensures the battery will have a long lifespan. Orion Gadgets, are you listening?After four hours of charging, the battery was restored to 100% capacity. With a few days of use and three or four recharges, the new LG battery provides about the same time between charges as the original LG battery that came with my Venice. (Three hours of Netflix on wi-fi or GPS navigation using 3g, or up to 24 hours per charge for a few brief phone calls and texting).You can buy three LG batteries from Orion Gadgets for the price of just one at the Sprint or Boost Mobile store.

Well worth the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |11 20, 2013|A3AFELPYTZH90T|Baja Alan                        |A Winner                                                        |1384905600    |[13, 16, 5, 10, 23, 4]             |\n3998899561|[3, 3]  |5.0    |Performs exactly as advertised .

It doesn&#39;t heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn&#39;t wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can&#39;t even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won&#39;t let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don&#39;t know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I&#39;ve made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays.

This passed and I stocked up.

The only problem I had was I had to return the first one because the clip on the holster when I knocked into the wall.  the second one has been fine.  Oh, and there were some comments about the phone not locking into the holster securely, as well it not locking in with the screen facing outward, which is necessary if you want to use the stand feature of the holster.  I have NO problem doing either of these.  Simple trick is to be careful, listen for the click of it locking in and give it a tug to make sure.

If you put it together, and don't take it apart to change batteries, then it will last a life time.  But, and a huge but, if you change batteries, as I do, then the little clips that hold the case together, will start to break and render the case useless.  That is if you don't use the rubber outer protector.  This will keep the inner case together.Bottom line is I will order another one as the price has dropped.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I guess I should read descriptions more, because I didn't realize this comes with a screen protector too.  Well made and about 15 bucks cheaper than buying it locally from my provider.This is an awesome protector for any phone, and the plastic screen saver doesn't seem to hamper the works of the original touch screen at all.  Cleaning is easy, just wipe it without worry about messing up the screen of the phone.  The belt clip takes some getting used to, but after about two days use, I have figured out the best way to wear it with my daily activities, (the clip swivels so you can rotate it 360 degrees.At first, it was aggravating with the very tight fit of the case and holster, because the first time I tried to change the battery, it actually took some negotiation and patience to get everything back off.  Yes, it's that much of an exact fit. But, as the saying goes, \"practice makes better\" so have I become with changing batteries and thus, it's not that much of a hassle anymore.I don't like the fact that the only way you can clip it to a belt if via a \"pin\" contraption, instead of both, the clip and a \"loop\", gives this a thumbs down. I prefer a \"Loop\" while at work and also out in public as it makes it really difficult to accidently become unattached with the phone or to have it \"lifted\" from you by a thief.The main reason I am so adamant about a \"loop\" over a clip is that it is easier than most will admit to dislodge a clip from your belt and you will not even know it until it's too late and you have totally lost your phone. Once, while getting out of my vehicle to pump some gas, I accidently dislodged my phone from my  belt and my phone fell to the pavement while I was pumping gas... After returning from paying for it, I just happened to look down and low and behold, there laid my phone right under the door of my vehicle. If I had been I a hurry or wasn't so attentive, I would have drove off and thus, been out of a phone and would have had to pay full price for a replacement, not to mention what the increased bill could have been if someone had found it and decided to dial 900 numbers on my account.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.757308280051963, 0.24269171994803695))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I never used this because I did not like the windows phone, so I returned the phone.If the live tile's and camera is all this phone has, they have a long way to go.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.41352867059648574, 0.5864713294035143))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Well, I work from home so I don't drive much... and this was used may be once per week...The spring on the holder gave way after 10 months...I contacted Caseology, Koomus and Amazon on the same day...Amazon took care of the return (A+)Koomus answered all of my inquiries (A+++), I'm not a Koomus ownerCaseology never wrote back...the Caseology product says Xenomix on it... while the Koomus one that I just got says Koomus.

After I returned it, the first one I purchased fell apart also. I didn't want to look for another tablet mount so I figured out why they fell apart. The springs in the clamp are anchored to very short posts. The slipped off the post causing the clamp to come apart. I couldn't find a locking washer small enough to fit on the post inside the body of the clamp. The next best thing, I reattached the springs and dabbed super glue over the posts, to hold the springs in place, and reassembled the clamp. It works perfect.

It's a well-made case and fit my Galaxy S4 like a glove.  The raised front ridge around the screen is deep enough to give a sense of security about face-first drops.  The case doesn't interfere with any camera or speaker.The negatives: the microUSB port cutout on the bottom of the case can only accept OEM Samsung cables.  Even then, it's a struggle to get it in because the hole is cut with maybe a hair's width of clearance on each side.  Furthermore, the volume controls and power button are incredibly stiff.  Good from a safety standpoint, not so much from the livability.On the plus side, because of the reasonable price, I'm not terribly concern with taking an Xacto knife to the port hole rather than returning it.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.39332182738550464, 0.6066781726144954))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Anker is the only product I trust when it comes to batteries for my samsungs.I've tried one other just to compare and I returned it after 2 days.Price is amazing, packaging is gorgeous.

Those were my husband exact words when he opened it up inserted his phone and put it on. The fit is very nice and you can tell its qualoty just by looking at it.The phone is completely functional inside the case and the key pouch puts it over the top for excellence. My husband and I both hit the gym pretty hard and the case is thick enough that sweat doesn't soak through to the phone.Infact I like it so much that ill be ordering one for myself and returning the one that I got ( it broke after one workout). Recommended!**UPDATE** 5/21/2014So my husband and I both had issues with the velcro and my husband had issues with the size.  For his it kept popping off ( his arm is about 16 inches) you could tell the velcro was weak over all.  Mine the velco was holding ok not great until about a week after the return window closed.  Then it would just fall off, which was not fun.So I sent an email to Gear Beast (who contacted me after the return of my husband's arm band to inquire about the issues), they advised that they made improvments to the velcro and size adjustments.They sent out a new model for me and my husband free of charge!

Of course, you can use your own phone's proprietary charging wire.+ CHARGES OFF ANY STANDARD USB CHARGER - you can use either then provided wire or your own.The bads:- The built-in charging Micro-USB wire is a little short - about one inch because you don't want to stretch it too much - and it's not easy to pull out. This charger is meant to be used by responsible adults.- Too shiny - both the front and back come in a super-shiny finish, making it a fingerprint collector (on this white version the fingerprints are less visible than on the black model).- The manual's English is atrocious - this is a Made in China product. The product's quality is excellent but the maker should hire a native English-speaker/writer to fix the manual.Overall, I am quite pleased with the product. The functionality is there, the in-body charging wire is an innovation that makes the product stand out, the small/light body is 'right' and the few 'bads' that I noted may or may not matter to any particular user.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.966541932137338, 0.033458067862662))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I just plugged my Kindle HDX in to charge from the &#34;Tablet&#34; outlet that I understood to be rated at 15 watts, well my Kindle opened a window saying a low powered charger was connected and that it wouldn't sufficiently charge using that charger.

It causes the image to have like a white shading in it.The power button has to be pressed \"straight on\" to work. It takes a little more effort than without the case. Not terrible, but noticeable.The back of the case is a hard plastic or \"polycarbonate\" material,  and the end (black bumpers) are like a hard rubber. This in itself is not a con other than the back is slippery. You have to hold on to it more so than if the case back had a more rubbery feel like the Diztronic cases.UAG should have made the back of the case, that \"soft touch\" plastic material to help with better grip.The sculpting of the back of the case is why I think it's cool, however you also feel the sculpting in you palm when holding it, and it's not the most comfortable.With the above issues, I should have returned it, but I think I will keep it for the days when I want extra protection over my Diztronic case.It's way over-priced as well.

Tracfone has more control over their phones than what they would readily reveal, but it's hardly worth the time involved in getting everything corrected when I would never consider using it in place of an Android anyway.  The 840's Web browser is very basic.LG also made an attempt to provide a suitable clipboard memory in this 840, but unfortunately that fell short of expectations as well, so it's one and only success remains in its Bluetooth provision that received some improvement over its LG800G predecessor. Bluetooth remains as its one shining ability other than being a truly reliable text/voice phone that is made even less costly by allowing triple minutes.We can hope that the successor of this phone will be better provisioned and include reliable components, so if not yet decided about this phone, then I would suggest passing this one up for now in favor of the much more extensive and rewarding abilities provided in a variety of other smartphones that sell for about the same price as this mere toy.UPDATE:  July 29, 2013I made corrections above regarding this smartphone and should also state that a fair appraisal of this little phone would also include some features I neglected to cover previously. In fact it has a couple more rather welcome and significant improvements over its LG800G predecessor, the first being its ability to be connected to a PC as a mass storage device. This allows data files, videos, music, pics, etc. to be copied or moved from your PC directly to the phone's internal memory so they can be viewed, played, or sent by this phone. Secondly, it shows a superb ability to play recorded movies or video and sound podcasts and mp3 music. Videos must be converted first and conform to sizing specifications, and the directions for doing all of this can be found with a search of the Web.</td><td>List(2, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7994533363793463, 0.20054666362065363))</td><td>2.0</td><td>Save your money kids.

After finding that my local WalMart had one phone left, I snagged it and haven't regretted my purchase one bit.What I love about the phone:1. WiFi calling (set up instructions below) - calls are clear, but calls don't hand off to cellular network if you step outside of your WiFi range2. Tethering Capable (must add to your plan as a separate service, but no charge)3. MicroSD slot (up to 64GB)4. Camera is touch adjustable5. Adjustable font size6. Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7. Transfer My Data App makes switching phones super easy - even transfers text messages8. All of the Nokia app collection for free (drive, music, photobeamer, yousendit, etc).9. Touchscreen is very responsive - sensitivity is adjustable10. Visual voicemail (free, but have to enable your account)The few negatives:1. Camera isn't fancy, but is 5mp. Use fingers/touchscreen to zoom. There is not a flash, so indoor pics can be blurry.2. Phone supposedly won't be able to access the LTE network if available in your area. I haven't confirmed this claim. The phone speed is fast enough for my needs, but I am not a gamer.3. Plastic back. Does it matter? Most people use a cover anyway.The OKs:1. Screen is nice and easy to see indoors. Sunlight causes difficulties. I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2. Phone does not come with a headset3. Phone does not come with a car charger4. The ear sound can get tinny. I use to up the volume to hear on other phones. In this phone, I turn down the volume to get rid of the tinny sound. This is not noticeable when on speakerphone.I really like this phone - it has all of the features I want at a fantastic price point. If you are buying a Windows phone (and you should), this phone is a no-brainer.WiFi calling set-up: get wifi calling enabled on your t-mobile account (free set up), and make sure that you have a wifi enabled sim card (free at TMobile store).  Then do a hard reset on the phone (not just a simple update).  Reset is found at Settings - About - reset your phone. Once you do these steps, a WiFi calling button will appear on your home screen. Press it and choose your option (Wi-Fi Preferred, Cellular Preferred, Wi-Fi Only).EMail/Social Media set-up: was a Breeze. I set up Hotmail, outlook, Gmail, roadrunner and a business email. Facebook and other social media is also very easy to set-up.Font size & High contrast screen is at Settings - Ease of Access.Tethering is at Settings - Internet sharing.(This review is not intended to endorse a third party seller.)SOFTWARE UPDATE (news release 8/16/13):The Windows Phone Amber update--available for Nokia's Lumia 920, 820, 720, 620, 520, 928, 822, 521 and 810--includes Smart Camera, which promises users the tools to create higher-quality photos by taking a series of rapid-fire shots then editing the best elements of each image together, further bolstered by filters and effects.Windows Phone Amber also touts Nokia Glance Screen, which adds a clock to the screen when the phone is inactive, alongside indicators that depict the battery level when the device is running on a low battery, charging or set to silent mode. \"You can activate the Nokia Glance screen in the 'display and touch' section in Settings by swiping left to 'glance,'\" said Nokia Conversations blog editor Ian Delaney. \"Nokia Glance screen will be available for all WP8 Lumia devices except the Nokia Lumia 520 and Lumia 625, which have a smaller display memory.\"Following customer requests, Windows Phone Amber additionally resurrects features from older Nokia handsets. Users may now flip the phone over to mute incoming calls and double tap the screen as an alternative to the unlock key.\"The rollout starts now first for the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 in selected countries as well as the Lumia 521, Lumia 810 and Lumia 928 in the U.S.,\" Delaney said. \"Exact delivery timings will vary by region, phone and operator, but we expect the update to reach your Lumia 520, Lumia 620, Lumia 720, Lumia 820 or Lumia 920 by the end of September.\"UPDATE (12/6/13T Mobile changed their international features outin Oct 2013, allowing free data & texting in areas they serve (phone calls .10 unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).  I took & used my phone to Peru & it worked quite well, both roaming on the Moviestar network (free) & hooking up to wifi.  I tethered to my tablet as well.UPDATE (3/28/14)I just returned from a trip to Vietnam where I used the Lumia 521 continuously both roaming & WiFi. In airports and other venues that had spotty or no WiFi, I tethered my phone to my tablet & to another user's tablet. WiFi calling provided free calls back to the states & using my apps, including Facebook, was a breeze.  TMobile's free international features are awesome (free texting & data, $.20/minute network calls, free WiFi calling to states, not in-country) and saved me hundreds of dollars.That said, I'm finding that I use my phone a lot more to take pictures, and the 521 only has a 5mp camera & no front facing camera.  The 5mp is OK & my phone has taken some very nice pictures, but now I want more & will probably upgrade to the Lumia 925 down the road (hoping for a T Mobile phone similar to the Lumina 1020).UPDATE (7/18/14)The Lumina 521 was resistant to its first fall into water, but after a longer second dunking, it died.  It died slowly in order to give me a chance to find a temporary replacement, but death was its final outcome (it survived 1 swim & multiple drops).  Since the Lumina 925 has fallen in price, I ordered it as a replacement. The Lumia 925 has an 8MP rear camera & is suppose to take good low light pictures. It also has a front facing camera.  It does not have the micro SD card slot that the Lumina 521 has.</td><td>List(407, 432)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7809754328659494, 0.21902456713405058))</td><td>1.0</td><td>This pouch is way too big for the battery.

I can say it lives up some of the claims yet stays far away for a few others here is a breakdown:Pros:1- Ultra clear visibility: This deserves a big plus since some other screen protectors I have had in the past were ruining the image quality or introducing lots of rainbows. This has neither. You don't even notice a slight decrease in the viewing quality. Perfect..2- No decrease in the screen sensitivity: This another great advantage for the side of this product. I have enjoyed the sensitive screen of this phone and it is good to know that I don't need to sacrifice from it for the sake of added protection.3-Relatively easy installation: I have suffered a lot from other screen protectors about installation. Trying again and again,  wasting a few and returning some... Compared to those discouraging experiences, this is as easy as it could be. Just make sure there is not much air circulation in the place of operation (introduces dusts) clean the surface with the included cloth and wear latex free gloves.That fits nice not overlapping the edges. The only difficulty is where the second sheet sign removing sign stays (below right corner). When you apply the screen you need to remove the second layer by pulling that part and yet it introduces bubbles and/or dusts by elevating the corner. Non careless action of mine introduced a nasty bubble which I made worse while trying to remove and ended up losing one out of three screen protectors. (That was mostly my fault though.)4- Affordable price: Less than $7 per 3 shields including free prime shipping) is as good as you can getCons:1- Finger print resistance: It is nothing close to being finger print resistant, on the contrary it looks more like a finger print magnet (unless my fingers have something extraordinary.) I would not treat this as a negative point if they did not make that claim. Since it is very difficult to achieve a finger print resistant stuff.2-It is not anti glare: You may experience annoying reflection depending on the angle and the illumination of the surrounding3- The design is a little different from what it shows in the picture. The speaker on the screen looks like a separate opening on the screen but actually it is a continuation of the nearby groove which is fine but that design would look slightly better. Besides it would be good if they made a small notch in the lower edge where the microphone lays. Here it covers that area and it may affect the sound reception yet I am not sure about it.Other than those points, I have nothing to say about how scratch resistant it is. I am sure it offers at least some level of protection but as of know I can not comment on it..Overall I am happy for the purchase since my expectations were not that high, but I did not give it 5 stars since it does not live up to some of the claims listed in the product description...</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5639733454877413, 0.43602665451225875))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Having just returned a previous folio case I had purchased for my HTC DNA, I was rather skeptical when I first saw this item; However, after deciding to 'check it out' and purchased it, I could not have made a BETTER DECISION, as  I am VERY HAPPY to have purchased it!!

Skinomi responded by sending a replacement without too much red tape. All they asked for was a photo showing scratch damage. They were fast to respond to my feedback and ship a replacement. I had a new protector within 5 days of my initial reported issue. Skinomi stands behind their product and for that alone, I will be an ongoing return customer.HD CLARITY: As is the same for my HTC One protector, the screen clarity is great. As a matter of fact, I am almost convinced it is a little better than having no screen protector at all (though my guess for this reason is the anti-smudge coating and the added UV protection).SMUDGE RESISTANCE: Many protectors I've used have advertised anti-fingerprint resistance, but they often either don't live up to the hype, or come with an even worse trade off, like a greatly decreased clarity, or a grainy look. Though this isn't smudge proof, one thing is for sure; Smudges are removed VERY easily and they don't rub in or spread. Instead they bead up (get smaller) and eventually either evaporate away or rub off in normal use. If you are a phone user and it is important to you to have a clear and clean screen, then I feel there aren't going to be many products better for those needs than this one.INSTALLATION: Once again, I was very pleased with the ease of installation. Nothing has been more burdensome than getting some small particle under the protector and getting that resultant air bubble that just won't go away. Even though i had a few small little barely noticeable particles under the screen protector for this one too, I was able to push those couple of little air bubbles out with ease or just apply a little pressure and the air bubbles would disappear.TOUCH/SENSITIVITY EXPERIENCE: This is not affected in the slightest from what I can notice. I use the stylus fairly often, and have not noticed any lack of re-activity to it either. One added benefit is that sliding my fingers around on the screen is more effortless. There is almost never a dragging or sticky feel when using my fingers on the touch screen to navigate my smart phone's functions.PRICE/PACKAGING/SHIPPING: I was happy with the quality of the packaging. The product was well protected so that it would be fairly difficult to damage the product during shipping. The price for this product was also well worth the $15 spent. There are other products with similar qualities for $50 or more.SCRATCH RESISTANCE/DURABILITY: I have noticed a couple of small barely noticeable scratches appear on the protector. To be honest, I am not altogether sure they weren't pre-existing on the tempered glass. I still don't notice them hardly, but this alone supports that the screen is not impervious to scratches. I have found that metal abrasion has not proven to harm these protectors like that from keys, scissors or a knife, but I have noticed that course sandpaper like dirt granules will do their damage without too much effort as noted with the  Skinomi Tech Glass protector on my HTC One; so even if you have this installed, you can't just toss it around like it is invincible. Regarding the durability for this product's drop resistance, this remains untested.ADDED BULK AND WEIGHT: This screen protector is 0.33 Millimeters thick. It doesn't seem like much, but it is noticeable. On the Galaxy Note 3, if you look at the home button, the protector will make the screen surface almost flush with this button. That (in my opinion) wasn't an altogether bad trade-off. Actually, it adds the small advantage that the home button won't tend to be pressed by accident while in my pocket. I would also note that I was a bit concerned at first that dirt, grime, oils and loose particles would find their way into the little crevasse around the home button made the the raised screen protector, but that has not been a problem what-so-ever as of yet. Also, the rounded edge makes the Tech Glass look as if is built in as part of the phone. This is even less noticeable on the HTC One. The added weight, however, is noticeable as to me seems to have been the only notable drawback of the product so far.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERALL: I would honestly have to say I have become a Skinomi customer for the foreseeable future. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a great quality screen protector for their phone. I took the time to type up this review, because I know there are many phone users out there who care about protecting their screens too. When I myself am on the lookout for a quality product, I read the user reviews and try to find the most descriptive ones both positive and negative to help in my decision making in regards to wise purchase decisions. I feel that paying that forward for other potential users and honoring Skinomi for their unwavering commitment to integrity and quality by sharing my own experience was due.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.620572396636357, 0.379427603363643))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I bought this offline for $11 and was ready to return it if it failed, but so far it has remained on my windshield all week and my phone stays stuck. It is a little hard to pull off the phone, cannot do while driving (thus 4 stars), but I grip the phone tightly, thumb one side and fingers on the other and hold the Grip Go with the other hand and peel it off. This works for me. I have tried probably 6-7 different phone/gps holders and this is the easiest to use and most reliable so far, except for the Garmin GPS clip-in one, but I dont take it on and off the holder.  Summer heat is the real test of the suction cup. That usually ruins them. The other problem with others I have used is they have sliding arms that have to be spread to put the phone on it, and adjusted, so putting it on one-handed while driving is not possible. Those arms also break easily. With GripGo I just stick it on with one hand. I like the length of the GripGo arm also as it reaches from windshield to within easy reach while driving to see and change a song on the iphone. I went on and bought another GripGo for my backup camera monitor. For the price I will be happy if they last a year.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7988335254209866, 0.20116647457901338))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I loved this cable and the idea of it, but I think I'm going with the Chrome Cast.

Some of the reviews were good and some were bad.  I thought I'd take a chance and try and replace my own battery.  There are some great videos on YouTube on how to replace the battery of the iPhone 5.  The first thing to do is to remove the screws on the side of the iPhone.  The enclosed screw drivers were way too large and did not have the correct type head.  The iPhone 5 has a star shaped hole in the screw head.  The kit I received had a Phillips type head which if you did use you could, with sufficient pressure, remove the screw heads at the expense of rounding out the entire head of the screw.  There was no suction cup enclosed which is needed to remove the cover from the unit.  I happened to have a suction cup that I use in the bathroom which I used to try and remove the cover.  There were a couple of tools to help pry the cover from the unit, but I could not get them to work.  At this point I gave up and went to an Apple dealer and had them replace the battery with an original Apple battery.  Rather than go through the hassle of returning the tool set, I just gave the battery to the Apple dealer and told him to do what he wanted with it.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the tool kit and I would not recommend it to anyone looking to replace the battery on their iPhone 5.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8404050516006936, 0.1595949483993064))</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is a preliminary review.

Rather than bore you with details already covered by the product description and other reviewers, I'll just share my experience.Pros: The charger does what it claims - charged both my Galaxy Note III and Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 at the same time.  However, it would randomly decide to charge fast or slow.  I haven't been able to figure out what triggers this behavior, but it's a little annoying being that it's the same car.Cons: I have two minor issues.1. The two red indicator lights stay on ALL the time.  It doesn't turn green or yellow, just red.  So, I have no idea when it's charging unless I look at the device.  There is also no way to turn them off without some DIY intervention.2. While streaming a Netflix movie and you plug the Note III into this charger, the audio \"mutes\" and there is no way to turn audio back on.  Unplugging the charger returns audio to normal.  This could be annoying if the battery is low and you want to stream video.Concern:  The battery on my Galaxy Note I was at 1%, so I tried to shutdown the phone.  Guess what, it would reboot - does not shutdown.  After having been plugged in, I had to remove the battery to shutdown.  What I also found is that while the phone is off and you plug into the car charger, the phone turns on and boots as if something is shorted.  Maybe the charger doesn't work well with Galaxy Note I, but works fine with Note III.Construction:  Feels solid and well made, at least on the outside.Would I recommend this product?  Absolutely.</td><td>List(4, 4)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.27455421733430757, 0.7254457826656924))</td><td>5.0</td><td>OH this is Good!At 2\" high and a 3\" diameter, this unit almost weighs almost a pound, which is why the sound is so good.  If you're looking at all the dozens of Bluetooth portable speakers out there, you may want to take a serious look at the \"ECANDY Bluetooth speaker\".It charges with a 3.7 V built-in aluminum battery in about 1-2 hours through an enclosed USB cable.  It easily pairs quickly to just about any device.  The speaker will last up to four hours!  For sound clarity, it is one of the best, with a punchy but not boomy bass.  The midranges are delightfully crisp and the trebles are distinct.  Sometimes, I hear instruments I've never heard before.  The volume can be loud enough to be used outdoors.You also have the option of hooking this up directly to your device (mobile phone, etc.) with the enclosed 3.5mm cable.  This speaker is actually perfect for an office space.  When a phone call comes in, the speaker quickly goes dormant and you can answer your call.Not all is perfect with this model however.  All the control buttons are on the bottom - in fact the unit rests on the three control buttons, meaning you have to turn the unit upside down to work them properly.  The arrangement is odd as well.  One button is for pairing, pause and play.  Another is for fast forward (to next song) and volume up.  The third is return (to previous song) and volume down.  I can think of an easier way to combine these functions.  The functions are visible on the top and bottom of the unit, but they are silver on silver and black on black, making reading a bit difficult.Having said that; for the price of the speaker and the absolutely fantastic sound quality, I have to say this is the best portable Bluetooth speaker I have found to date.

The top (which holds all the devices) separates from the base and could be a disaster if you are not careful. It is also for this reason you want to get your cords situated and just leave it as is. My smartphone charger connects at the bottom so it has to sit on the base sideways and looks silly, but that is not really a dealbreaker.I was 50/50 on it before the piece broke off. I have inquired with GUS about a refund and they told me because it was past the 30-day return window all I could receive was a 15% discount on a subsequent purchase. So my takeaway from this is a) they do not stand behind their overpriced, cheaply-made products, and b) rather than receiving full-credit I am required to make another purchase to make good on their pitiful attempt at customer satisfaction/goodwill.

The speaker comes on FULL BLAST no matter what volume the TV is set at. So now you're scrambling to get the volume turned down on the speaker before it blows out either your eardrums, or the speaker itself. Same issue when connecting to my iPhone.

I searched the internet for hours trying to find the manufacturer, additional instructions, support of any kind... nada. Not sure who \"Photive\" is, but they have no internet presence, no phone number to call.  I call that a clue.4. Decided to return it... getting a replacement wasn't an option offered, only return for a refund. I call that clue #2... why not offer me a replacement speaker?  I think this product is no longer being manufactured, what inventory is left is being dumped on Amazon. My opinion.So, good luck with yours, I had none with mine... I gave it two stars simply because when I was able to pair the speaker and get the volume down to a decent level, it did seem to have great sound from such a small package.</td><td>List(2, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9824472607386499, 0.017552739261350092))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I purchased this battery to power both an iPhone 5s and an iPad Air. Lets start out with what I liked. The battery is made of a non-slip material that is very easy to hold. It&#8217;s shape makes it easy to put into a pocket, granted a cargo pants pocket but a pocket nonetheless. It&#8217;s about the same size as the Otterbox Defender case for the iPhone 5/5s as another reviewer pointed out. The flashlight is nice for when you need light in a pinch.Now for what I didn&#8217;t like. I really wanted to like this battery for the reasons above but here is the reason it&#8217;s getting returned. Simply put, for my use case. It&#8217;s worthless as a charger for my iPad Air. When I first started to use the unit. I charged it fully before the first use. Then I plugged the iPad and iPhone into it. Both had about a 10% charge. The iPhone eventually did get to 100% after a few hours, but it still said charging, not on AC Power like it does when a charge is complete. The iPad however lost power, then gained power. I think it only was able to struggle to the teens. After a few hours of waiting. I unplugged both iDevices and recharged the battery to 100%. I figured maybe two devices charging at the same time was the issue so I just plugged my iPad Air into the 2A port. Again I noticed the iPad both gaining and losing power percentage points. Even when I stopped using it and put it down to charge with the screen off. Maybe I got a dud but I don&#8217;t have the time or the patience to mess around with tech support because I need something that will work by the end of the week.If anyone out there in Amazon land has a recommendation of a external battery that can charge both an iPad Air and an iPhone 5s in a reasonable amount of time with power to spare. I&#8217;m all ears.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9134508256704097, 0.0865491743295903))</td><td>3.0</td><td>The cable works and is in perfect condition however I ordered a 5 ft cable and received one that was approx. 2.5 ft .

I have no complaints about the fit or finish, I installed the GN3 with the plastic ring in place as recommended by other buyers, and this worked very well. The fit is snug and secure. I had previously installed a Verizon branded  tempered glass screen protector, and the edge of the case matched up very well with the edges of this protector. There is nothing wrong with this case. I bought a case designed for beauty and elegance, and that is exactly what this case is. However, I need a little more protection. I need a slightly deeper inset for the screen to protect it when face down. I need a grippier surface on the edges. The plastic bezel is very shiny and very slippery. The case is quite thin, maintaining the sleekness of the GN3, but in combination with the glossy edge surfaces, it means that picking up the phone from a table or desk requires a very firm grasp. The case slides very easily into and out of a front pocket, and thinness is a virtue in this respect. However, going back to my need for a grippier edge, I took GREAT care when removing the phone from my pocket to avoid losing it on the way out. The buttons are very functional, and the pressure needed to activate is just right.In summary, if you need a sleek and fashionable case that will enhance the elegance of the GN3 while giving fairly good protection in gentle use, you can't go wrong with this case. I ended up returning it in favor of a case with a little less elegance and a little more ruggedness. I will review those cases separately.

My wife bought this for me as part of my birthday gift so the actual purchase is under her Amazon account.  This case will COMPLETELY protect your phone, without a doubt.  It has a solid feel to it and I'm not afraid if I happen to drop it on gravel or concrete.  It gets an A+ for case protection and durability.  I have been using it a couple of months now.  There are a few common complaints that I want to address from other reviewers.S-View - I know many people, including myself, had an issue with the S-View function.  It would stop working and to get it to work again I had to take the case off.  If you have this problem, send an email to Spigen.  They quickly sent me over a new chip to replace the one in the case.  It works perfectly now!  I was ready to return the case but decided to reach out to Spigen first to give them a chance to do the right thing.  I would have given 3/5 stars with a case that had a dysfunctional feature but Spigen customer service provided me a quick fix in replacing the chip.Hinge - I read previous reviews saying that the hinge is a weak point and can break easily.  While this may be true, if you drop your phone when the case is opened and the hinge breaks; I don't blame the hinge for breaking.  There may be merit that the hinge is inherently weak but if it breaks because I dropped the phone that isn't the cases' fault but mine.Final thoughts:Compared to the price of the Samsung S-View case, this is a bargain.  I had the Samsung S-View case but I wanted something that offered better overall protection.  Would recommend to all my family, friends and Amazon users.  One more thing I wanted to add concerning the Samsung S-View case; the front cover would flap or wouldn't close properly.  Spigen makes a magnetic clip that works perfectly for this problem.  I gave my old case to my dad and bought the magnetic clip for him.  Works great.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.25880037690591606, 0.7411996230940839))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Great case!  Worth the investment if you&#8217;re hard on your phone like I am.  My last IPhone I scratched up by throwing it in my purse.  When I bought the Note 3 I decided I would care for the phone and make sure it always had full protection.  When I ordered the case it was on back order, so I had to wait 5 days.  Once I got it, if the case they send it in is any indication of the protection of the phone, I got the right case.  It was really easy to install, I just pushed in the upper half in and snapped in the bottom in.  I did have to do it twice as it didn&#8217;t pick up my s view right away.  Once I got it in and I made sure the phone was securely in the case, I made sure the contact on the back of the phone was completely together.  Calls and s-view worked great.  It does add a little weight, but for the protection it&#8217;s worth it to me.  I like that over the Samsung case this one comes with a snap, so you don&#8217;t have to purchase an extra magnet.  I originally bought the Samsung case and returned it.  I also like the hinge, since there aren&#8217;t any good options out there for a Note 3 case with full protection and a kickstand; this case gets you as close as possible.  The hinge allows you to set your phone up in different angles.  I think the case looks good, I get compliments on it. I would highly recommend this case.  This is my first Spigen and I will be a return customer.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8227406862329415, 0.17725931376705858))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I bought this to so I can use my smartphone on business trips instead of renting a GPS.

Having said that...I have been using Anker chargers in my home, in my office, in my car and on the go (Astro portable power supply) for a couple of years now and they consistently deliver high quality, solid products.  I had an Anker charger in my car before receiving this one and was very pleased with it.  However, I was excited to see that they have increased the current capacity from 3.1 to 4.8 amps.  This charger is small and attractive and the ability to charge 2 devices at the same time at a full charging rate is welcome.  My wife and I both have iphones and we need to charge both in the car on long road trips.  We were able to do so before, but not at the full charge rate (apple devices draw higher charge currents than most devices).  Now we can and from the testing I've done so far, this charger outperforms both the older Anker model as well as similar products from other manufacturers.If you have the older Anker model and are considering upgrading for the increased current capacity, there are a couple of differences to be aware of: First, there is no USB mini cable permanently attached to this charger like there was with the previous iteration.  This charger has two full size USB ports instead (which personally I find much more useful).  Second, they removed the blue LED indicator light.  Personally that is my only real complaint with this charger.  I really liked having that light because with the location of the outlet in my car, I tended to pull the charger loose on occasion and like having that warning if I did so.  On the other hand many people complain about indicator lights in general being distracting when driving at night so I understand the decision to remove it.Another positive I've found with this charger is that it \"locks\" into the car outlet more securely than many I've used (including the earlier Anker model).  For me, that pretty much makes up for not having the indicator light because now I don't inadvertently pull it loose nearly as frequently.I've tested this charger with iphone 4S, iphone 5s, ipad 2, galaxy tab and the anker astro power pack.  I got consistent charging on all devices that appeared to be at approximately the same rate as when plugged into a wall charger.  There was never any intermittent losses of connection that you sometimes see with cheap chargers.  Given my history with Anker, I have no doubt this charger will last as long as I need it to (which is until Anker releases one even better!)  For the money, you can't beat it.  It's a convenient, reliable and high-quality charger that you can't go wrong with if you need to charge today's smartphones and tablets that cheaper 1.5 A chargers simply can't keep up with.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.18131942765895756, 0.8186805723410424))</td><td>5.0</td><td>PowerGen sent me this power bank for review - in other words, I didn't have to pay for it - but I never promise a positive review in return and this was not exception.If 'big and heavy' aren't negatives, then just about everything else about PowerGen's newest beast is super:- BIG CHARGE: its 14,000 mAh could mean a lot or not but it may be more helpful not note that it fully charged my HP Chromebook 11 and had enough juice left to charge it again to about 60%. That's a lot of juice.- SELF CONTAINED: if your device can be charged through a generic Micro-USB interface and most phones do, there is a permanently attached ribbon cable that you can use. There is also an attached Type A USB ribbon cable for charging the the power bank itself directly off most standard USB chargers.- FLEXIBLE: or you can provide your own cables for both charging the power bank and for charging your gadget. There is an Apple-optimized 1A port and a 'universal' 2.1A port for which you either supply your own cable or you can use the modular cables included that have Apple, Micro-USB and Mini-USB interfaces.- NOT A FINGERPRINTS MAGNET: finally there's a power bank that's not 'shiny'. I like that very much.- NICE DESIGN: yes, it's bulky and heavy but it comes in a good form with elegant chrome accents and pretty blue charge status lights.I would get one of these if I could use a lot of juice between powerbank refills. It should provide many charges to phones and should be able to rescue big tablets and in my case even a Chromebook and refill small tablets more than once.</td><td>List(7, 8)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7543904149729243, 0.24560958502707575))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Got this item for a roadtrip, tested it out, it worked.

Due to a spotty signal and a few earlier pictures and videos, the battery had exhausted pretty quickly. The only problem? I had forgotten my charging cable! So I had to go around from tent to tent, asking random (and in many cases unknown) people if they had a cable I could use. \"If only I had a battery case or portable charger...\", I thought. Well, now I do! When I received the opportunity to review the Belkin Grip Power Battery Case for iPhone 5, I jumped. The situation above was not something I wanted to deal with again. I have used and reviewed other Belkin cases with mixed results, so I was not sure what to expect. However, I have been pleasantly surprised by this case!Foremost, temper your expectations on size. This case IS hefty. While it only marginally increases the height and width of the phone, it manages to push the iPhone 5's quarter-inch thickness to nearly double! It also adds considerable weight, though it feels well-balanced. This appears to be bigger than some competing cases, BUT what you get in return is battery life and a well-designed case. But it's not necessarily a case you want to go running with, either.Let's review some of Belkin's product claims:Claim: \"Doubles the Battery Life of Your iPhone 5\"Finding: Charging from nearly dead, it took about 2.5 hours to get my phone to around 90%. That appeared to pretty much deplete the case's battery. So while that restored quite a bit of life, that's not quite \"double\". However, when using the case with a fully charged phone, I've managed to go a couple of days without charging on light/moderate use. The case appears to charge the phone at a rate of about 10% or so every 15-20 minutes (though this seemed to vary depending on what was running on the phone). The case has a small, unobtrusive button on the back for the purpose of checking battery life (of the case) or initializing a charge. It also has 4 small LEDs to display the battery life of the case. These are also small and look nice. I definitely found the benefit of this case was not in re-charging a dead phone for emergency use, but in \"topping off\" your battery when it starts getting low and thus extending the use cycle between charges.Claim: \"Protect Your iPhone 5 From Shocks and Scratches\"Finding: This case actually seems to excel at this, though I have not dropped it to see how it holds together. I have been very impressed by the \"fit and finish\" of this case. The way the bezel snaps on really gives it a \"seamless\" feel. The case I received is black and gray. It has a nice \"soft\" (matte) feel to it, with a glossy black bezel around the face of the phone. The bezel is slightly raised, so it will help prevent scratches if you lay (or drop!) your phone face down. But since the bezel is glossy plastic, it does not offer any kind of anti-slide functionality, either.Claim: \"Simple to Install and Use\"Finding: Installation was indeed a snap. Literally. You put the phone on the battery, and snap the bezel in place. Probably one of the easiest cases I've installed. Removal is simple, as well. I found the phone's buttons responsive and easy to use, with one exception - for some reason, they did NOT extend or cover the mute rocker switch! I have big fingers and no fingernails, and really struggle to get even my pinkie in the hole to toggle this switch. Of course, if you find yourself togging the switch by accident on other cases, this case should certainly negate that issue.Claim: \"Charge Both Batteries with One Cable\"Finding: This CAN be done, but it does seem a bit particular at times. First, the case only comes with a micro-USB cable - NOT an actual charger. So using your computer would take some time to recharge. I found that using other micro-USB chargers I had on hand worked fine, but some do not fit quite well into the small charging inlet. Also, when I plugged it into one the other night, I received the yellow triangle and warning that \"charging is not supported with this device\". But the next night (using the exact same cable and charger) it worked just fine. Since I synch wirelessly, I have not checked to see if synching will work via this case, but I would be quite surprised if it does.Claim: \"Take Photos and Use EarPods with the Case On\"Finding: Taking photos caused no problems. There was no issues of lense flare when using the flash. The earpod usage was a bit awkward. The case came with an extender/adapter to make it easier to plug/unplug your earpods without pulling on the wire. I did not notice any issues with call or sound quality using this extension, but it's a bit of an annoyance to remember to carry with me. That said, if you are careful the earpods WILL plug in without the extender. Honestly, though, I'm not sure why they didn't just build the extender into the case itself.Compared the price point for other similar cases on the market (such as the Mophie), the Belkin Grip Power case appears to offer similar quality and features for a much lower price. The only other issue I had was that, due to the thickness, it did not work with my iOttie EasyFlex2 dash mount. It also would not work with 30-pin accessory adapters, so that's something to consider. This will likely NOT be my full-time case, but will definitely be one I rely upon in situations where I may need extended battery life. Overall, I give it 4.5 stars, or a \"B+\" if you were grading it that way.</td><td>List(5, 5)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6211277011200201, 0.37887229887997986))</td><td>1.0</td><td>shoulda returned it while I could.. thing's a disappointment. it is not very comfortable and looks silly, the bluetooth keeps needing to be re-paired. the battery doesn't last very long and its constantly on the verge of being lost.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.31126454351737237, 0.6887354564826276))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Good points:*Fits my ears perfectly -- I get a substantial &#34;noise isolating&#34; effect, which if you do the research is actually more effective (and cheaper) than &#34;noise cancelling.&#34;*lightweight -- hardly know they're there*Freedom from cords!*VERY good software -- good feedback/alerts and seamless integration with iPhone 5/iOS7Weak point:Truthfully, the sound is not as good as other corded and cordless earphones I have tried, but it is close.  The deciding consideration was the low profile (stealth?) form factor.  To deal with the sound issue, I downloaded the Bongiovi sound processing app.  Dumb name, but a terrific sound enhancement app.Closing remarks:Ear fit and comfort is a very personal thing, so as a buyer you have to be ready to return these if they don't fit your particular ears.  That's just the reality of buying earphones.  For that reason, whenever you read reviews of earphones that are highly negative about fit and comfort, you have to look at the overall trend in reviews to decide if they MIGHT work for you.  Also, I highly recommend buying these earphones with the charging case.  The case is very well designed, lightweight, includes the ability to check the charge level on the case, and fits and protects the earphones perfectly.  Obviously, the case also adds several hours of play time, which is quite useful on long plane rides.  As cool as the earphones are, the case is one of those small, unexpected instances of thoughtful design that are a pleasure to come across.</td><td>List(2, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5961788307242751, 0.40382116927572487))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I am a Plantronics user since 20th century, when bluetooth would be a simple blue stain on our teeth.

I don't mind picking up my phone to answer it -- I want Bluetooth so I can listen to my music while I work, shutting out a little of the noise around me.I found two fairly serious problems as soon as I unpacked and charged the unit (and the battery case) and tried them out. The first problem is that even after trying all three sized cushions, I was unable to get these to fit properly in my ear. No matter how little or how hard I pushed on them, they fit poorly, didn't block outside noise, and were very loose. I've used dozens of ear bud products, both Bluetooth and wired, and never had this problem before with any buds, wireless or wired.The more serious problem was the very tinny sound. There was no way I could get any bass out of the units. When I compared this product to several pairs of the wired headsets I have laying around, I concluded that either this product was defective or it was just not designed for music. I considered calling the manufacturer's customer support line and working on the problem, but I just didn't want to get into all of that. I have worked in manufacturing and consulting quality control for years, and recognize that customers do not really want good customer service -- they don't want to need it. I returned it after trying every combination of music app and equalizer I could download on my Galaxy SIII for two days. The wired and an old Bluetooth headset were giving me great sound, but this Backbeat still sounded tinny -- as though it were intended only for phone conversations. I wanted to like it, and felt at the price I could expect to like it -- but I shook my head, re-packaged it and sent it back. I'll always be grateful for the amazing Amazon customer service.

The phone they sent me has a stuck pixel to the right side of the screen which flashes red from time to time (and sometimes just stays there, as a red dot). They knew about this and still sent it to me, how do I know? Because they had turned on the phone before, android didn't even ask me to set up my google account, something it always does when first turning on a factory reset phone, that's because they had already turned it on and installed some Region Code Lock away app or something like that. It's good that they took the time to do it if they at least informed me beforehand but this phone is supposed to be UNLOCKED from factory. If they didn't install this then it was the person they sold this to (and returned) before me.. and they didn't even had the decency of factory resetting it. Also, this page is for the galaxy s4 mini BLACK not BLACK MIST, the one they ultimately sent me. Luckily I also like that color but they shouldn't send something different than the one the page advertises.I had to go overseas right after getting the phone so I'm unable to return it (I also can overlook most of this, even the stuck pixel issue, which I think can fade over time) but beware of this SHOPEBEST SELLER since it is full of crap.UPDATE 05/25/2014For custom roms users: for me the battery life is way worse with cyanogenmod. I have always used custom roms in my previous phones but mostly based on touchwiz. This phone is the first one where I have used cyanogenmod intensively and while I love all the power user options of the rom I was extremely disappointed with the battery life. I just could not make it through the day without having to recharge it at work and I HATE to charge twice a day, it also isn't very good for the battery's health over the long term. Also, the battery life indicator was incredibly unreliable once you reached under 20% levels. You could have 15% battery life (on stock the phone can make it home safely with that) left and after ten minutes the phone will be at 4% and turning off. I was left out hanging because of this more than once and when I needed the phone the most (as I was just going home from work). That was using default cyanogenmod settings of course (default scheduler and governor, no overclock or undervolted, etc) but most of the fancy stuff disabled (location, gps, data sync, nfc, etc) the same way I have it with touchwiz. In fairness some people on XDA forums seem to get good battery life out of this phone on cm but I don't know what kind of customizations they have used (most undervolt) or how they use the phone I'm just talking of my experience here. Me? I happen to like touchwiz, a lot actually, always have. I specially like how it looks (I don't know what all the hate is about). I even used a touchwiz theme on cm (it never looked quite as good as touchwiz though but that is expected). About the cm power options I miss? I can have them using the Xposed framework with the touchwiz-specific Wanam Exposed module (make sure you know what you're doing before meddling with it, but is mostly safe, needs root). I had never used the Xposed framework before and IT IS AMAZING. Glad I found it since I now have alternatives in case I don't find good custom roms (for this phone they're all mostly cyanogenmod-based). I hope this helps. PS: I initially posted this on my 9195 review since that is the model I own now but it applies to the 9190 too, since I have used cyanogenmod with both.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5824653065813027, 0.4175346934186973))</td><td>5.0</td><td>This charges my phone at full speed like a wall outlet.

People on the other end reported that there was a bit of static in the background, but I could be understood.Good:+ BT 3.0 with noise suppression technology+ Light and easy to wear.+ Pairs with two devices. The pairing process went smoothly.+ Uses the near-universal MicroUSB charger.+ Supports a full set of standard functions: redial, mute, answer, reject, voice dial, call switching.+ Led indicates charging (red), charge complete (blue), Power on (blue flashes), Incoming calls, talking, not connected, battery low (red led and voice in the headset), red/blue flashing for pairing mode.+ Voice confirmation of pairing, searching, paired, connected, disconnected, power on and off.+ Power on/off+ Supports hearing the phone sounds in the earbud.Not so good:- The headset fits the ear a bit oddly, but it does stay in place and I can hear it. However I don't like the ear bud part as well as some other devices I have used.- There is no way to switch off the blue LED. These LEDs use up power, and make one look a bit like some kind of robot. I prefer to be more discrete, but some people actually like the LED, so I suppose this is a matter of opinion. It does remind one that the unit is powered on.- The Multi-Function Button (MFT) on this device controls answering, re-dialing, and basically everything. Unfortunately, it was broken on my unit. I could hear the button clicking, but it didn't do anything. Without it the device is pretty much useless, because I can't even answer an incoming call, much less activate my hands free features in the phone. I sent an email to the company, to which I received a very prompt reply to the effect that warranty replacement is 6.95 and one has to pay shipping. It is much easier to return to Amazon as defective. I felt compelled to hold back two stars because of this defect.Summary: A good set of features - but check yours carefully when it arrives; you may need to send it back to Amazon.

It can be used for Skype, phone calls or to listen to music on these devices.  Unfortunately it's ill-fitting, and the build-quality reflects its low price point. The sound quality is very good, but these other factors make me dislike using them.Pairing the device with both my Windows 7 PC and my iPad 3, didn't happen as quickly as with some other devices, but the headset did connect and maintain a connection.The V3.0 protocol supports HSP, HFP, A2DP, and AVRCP.  The range on the device is typical of most Bluetooth headsets; less than 10 meters from the device its connected to and it'll work. After a 2.5hr charge, you have 100 hours of standby time or less, before another charge is needed.  Talk time is 8  hours or less and music listening time is 6 hours or less of continual use per charge.The instructions that come with this headset are minimal. If you've paired Bluetooth devices before, you should be golden when it comes to setting up these and pairing them.  If not, it could be tricky.  There's not really a step-by-step 'how to pair' in the directions.  You do get suggestions on what to do prior to pairing though, and a small Quick Start Guide which basically outlines the buttons and parts on the headset.A USB to microUSB charging cord is included. Be sure to use care when lifting the door that covers the microUSB port on the device, as it would be easy to break it off.  *(Actually I went ahead and yanked it off, as it was so flimsy it wasn't going to last long and I don't expect to need it to be covered.)A cool feature of this headset is that it can be paired with two smartphones at the same time.\"Sport\" Stereo Bluetooth Headset is what it says on the packaging, with photos of people working out; wearing these headphones. I workout every other day, and I couldn't wear these headphones to do it, as the earpieces are 'one size fits all' and very uncomfortable!  The neck piece is also very short, and for those with larger heads (that apparently includes me...) these headphones don't fit.The sound from the headphones is surprisingly good, and call quality was also good - the mic picks up as it should.  The build quality of the headphones is as you'd expect for about twenty bucks, but these would be a good buy with the function of the headset IF the fit was better.As it stands, the large, uncomfortably shaped earpieces with no silicon padding and the short leash around the back of the neck that's not adjustable, both limit who can enjoy these headphones.If you have a small head, and aren't terribly fussy about large things inside your ears and pressure over the tops of your ears, you might find happiness with these.  I can'not recommend them for everyone though, and will not be using them past this review.NOTE:  I received this headset from the manufacturer in return for my honest, unpaid review.UPDATE: 12/7/13This is an email I received from the manufacturer after posting this review.\"Hi Andrea:We got your review on our Bluetooth headphone.Thanks very much for your insightful review that let us know the cons of this product. We have made decisions to improve this headphone.The neck piece will be lengthened or become stretchable. The earpieces will also be improved with silicon or sponge to make it more comfortable to wear. We even have improved the instruction (Attach file is the content for instruction).As a result, customers will receive new gen headphones when they purchase on this product page.Actually, it's not a really bad headphone. Just as you said, the sound from the headphones is surprisingly good. However, your review with 2 out of 5 stars may make these headphones unsalable and would not be fit for the improved headphones.So, We sincerely ask you to delete the review that you posted.You have already done a good job in making our products more perfect. We appreciate your feedback.Thanks again!Steven\"I have responded to the email noting that I was posting it here, and would leave the review as written, but increased the star rating from 2 to 3 stars as it is OK for some.It is understood when I write reviews for products that they will be 'honest' and that may be good or bad, but always as fair as I can make them.  This company may not choose to have me review their products in the future, but that's OK.  I like that this company is taking their reviews seriously and improving their products.Please take this into consideration when purchasing from them.UPDATE: 2/20/14Received a comment on this review (see 'Comments') from a representitive of Mpow (maker of this headset) offering to replace it if I returned the other one.  I reminded them that I had received the product for testing and review, and that there was no situation that needed a remedy months after the initial review.As stated above, I believe this company is making every attempt to offer good customer service and this should be noted by potential buyers.  Unfortunately that doesn't change the 'fit' of this headset, which doesn't work for me.UPDATE: 5/9/14'Tim' (see comments) asked why I didn't review a replacement, to which I answered \"...the replacement was the same version I reviewed.\"In looking at Amazon's updated info on this product, they've changed out the original title and added '2nd Gen Sport' - which is NOT the product I reviewed.  THIS REVIEW is for the 1st Generation product that was originally sent to me by the manufacturer for an honest review. I have not received a second gen product, but would be happy to try it out of they send it to me to update this review further.It seems the company was very responsive to fit concerns and has taken quick action to remedy this, which again, is to their credit.Unfortunately the product has been given the older reviews despite the '2nd Gen' being the product that is now shipping. Fit issues may still exist, however I cannot at this time speak to them. I will update this review if that changes.</td><td>List(17, 19)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.758213284266299, 0.24178671573370109))</td><td>5.0</td><td>This cable works as intended.

However the enclosed instruction sheet does not make any reference to that fact.  It does state, quite emphatically, &#34;Do not expose to water or humidity&#34;.  A quite contradictory statement.In addition, the box makes only ONE warning in a  small font footnote, that the unit is not waterproof while charging.  The BOX is the ONLY place any reference, or any modicum of instruction, is given relative to the water resistant capability of the unit.This is not a very good thing, people usually just toss the box aside and look at the instruction sheet (if they even do that).The instruction sheet included in the NT120R's box, does not instruct the user to make sure that the cover is closed securely when not in use.  This could prove to be a major issue when people start having their units short out because they did not secure the port cover.  I know my Nikon AW100 (waterproof camera) instructions go over the whole topic of waterproof requirements in DETAIL.  Illustrations etc...  This is key.  New Trent needs to make sure that the user knows what they have to do in detail to make sure the unit functions as intended.  Forewarned.. make sure the cover is CLOSED!  The UNIT IS NOT WATER RESISTANT OR WATERPROOF in ANY capacity if the cover is open, or not closed completely!As a direct result of the contradiction between the box and instruction sheet, combined with the lack of any supporting supporting documentation, I was a bit timid to place the unit in to a bowl of water.  But, I did so anyway because it says I can on the box.Now, to be honest, I would never intentionally submerge the unit in my normal use.  However it may get exposed to rain.  I may get pushed into a swimming pool or fall off a mega yacht.Bottom line, a claim was made, I challenged it.I must admit, I was MORE than a bit nervous to run this little experiment.  Having a background in the computer industry, I know that any tap/pool/rain/toilet water can be fatal to an electronic device.  Knowing this, I made sure that the charging port cover was completely closed before I actually dropped the fully charged unit in to a large bowl of tap water.  I figured that if I fell  in to a pool the unit may be submerged for up to 1 minute before I was able to get out of the pool; so I left the unit submerged for a full 2 minutes.  Those 2 minutes seemed like an eternity.  I removed the unit, dried it completely, making sure the port cover was totally dry prior to opening it.  I plugged in my iPhone cable and powered up the unit.  It worked.  The waterproof claim was valid for my test parameters.I decided to test the durability if the NT 120R.I dropped the IMP120R down a flight of stairs.  It survived.  No visible damage. Worked as expectedI dropped it off a 6' high deck rail on to grass,  Again it survived.  No visible damage. Worked as expectedI dropped it 4' on to a concrete sidewalk. It Survived.  I am saddened to say that there was some visible cosmetic damage.  The point of impact suffered a minor scrape.  Nothing major. Worked as expectedThe IMP120R passed what I consider to be a representative array of the worst that should happen to a device when in normal use.It was never my intent to test to the point of destruction. After all, I need to be able to still use the unit!I often take my camera out in to the wild...  I usually carry a large assortment of power hungry devices along with me.  I was able to attach the IMP120R easily to my camera tripod, using the supplied lanyard and quick connect clip,  to supply power to a borrowed remote triggering device that proved to have a faulty battery pack.  Major plus!I decided to test the charging capability of the IMP120R as I would use it in the event of a power outage.  We no longer have a land line, so our cell phones are in use during the day and are usually charged at night.  Just like the majority of users.So I used the NT120R the unit to charge both my iPhone 5 and my iPad 3 simultaneously the past six nights.  Both units were ~20-30% charged when initially attached.  As I mentioned before, charging my devices at night is my normal operating process.  I definitely miss not having the power remaining lights visible when the IMP120R is charging devices.  There really is no indication that the unit is even turned on by looking at it when it is charging devices.  I had to check the devices to make sure they were in deed charging to convince me the unit was working the first time I connected it.  I was able to recharge both units 3 times on  one charge of theNT120R.I did NOT time how long it took to recharge the IMP120R due to the fact I usually charge my devices overnight, or my iPad during the day when I am at work.  As long as they are charged when I get up, or return home,  I am happy.  I was happy.To summarize:  The IMP120R is a device that meets my possible real world conditions.  It meets all my needs.I recommend this unit to any one who wants the security of a portable charging device for their cell phone or tablet device.  I also recommend this unit to photographers,  campers, hikers, bikers.. basically ANYONE who may need to power any USB powered device. .  this unit is awesome.I will be buying a couple more of these devices to give as gifts.As I stated earlier, I rate the actual NT 120R Unit a 5 out of 5.  The documentation however I rate a 1 out of 5 as it is severely lacking in very vital details.  I trust New Trent will correct that issue quickly.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7287696258016664, 0.27123037419833357))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I'm on the phone all the time for business purposes, so I need a good bluetooth headset.This headset had good sound, was comfortable, and the microphone worked very well.

I also had about $15 Amazon Credit that made 3 of these free and a 4th very cheap.So I bought 4. Initially they seemed to work well,  our phones showed the little lightning bolt over the battery icon indicating they were charging, but my brother quickly started complaining how slow his charger was compared to mine.I had bought a FRiEQ 6-Foot cable at the same time since I needed a longer cord. The FRiEQ is the best cable for charging that I have found PERIOD. Very well constructed, and charges everyone's phones fast (although none of our phones are rated to charge faster than 1 amp; so I can't speak on whether it charges a note phone, or a tablet fast)Today I discovered the helpful little app &#34;Battery Monitor Widget&#34; on Google Play. It shows in real time what a given cable/charge base combination feeds a phone.I found that NONE of these Samsung cables, regardless of the charge base, charged my brother's Nexus 4 faster than 0.4 Amps of current and they usually stayed around 0.3 Amps. While the FRiEQ cable with a stock 1.0 Amp output would charge consistently at 0.8-0.88 Amps. (Note, though the charger is CAPABLE of charging at a full 1.0 Amps, the phone only pulls what it wants, so 0.8 Amps is acceptable, as none of my cables charged the Nexus 4 faster)Very disappointed in these cables. Use them for strictly data transfer if you get them. They won't even charge at the 0.5 Amps a USB port gives.It's been 4 months since my purchase, so I'm not sure if I can return these.

For example, updated version no longer has designated slots for Android, iPad, and Samsung Tab devices, which eliminates any usage confusion.The 25W version worked great, but based on the item description I felt that it was not what I needed. It turns out that either charging device would work fine and is just a matter of need and preference.Now that the manufacturer has cleared up any ambiguity between the two products consumers just rest assured that they will get a great product from AnkerDirect.The Anker 25W USB charger is $5 cheaper than the 40W version. Both appear in the Amazon results page and are nearly identical in their descriptions.I purchased this, thinking it was the 40W version (apparently some improvements have been made, including not having to plug certain devices into designated spots). I kept it anyway, to avoid the hassle of returning it.Then I looked at the listing for the 25W version again. It said,\"AC 110-220V input voltage ideal for international travel.\"I needed this device for travel to a country with 240V electricity. So I returned this model for the 40W version, which purports to have a 240V input voltage. Anker contacted me afterward, telling me that the 25W version does in fact support 240V.This item worked fine but this company really needs to be more clear with their item descriptions.

There are already many glowing reviews so I'll just get to a couple of points not already mentioned.First off, while there are \"5 ports designed to charge the iPad (2 x 2.1A), iPhone (1A), Samsung Tab (1.3A), and Android devices (1A) at full speed\", these ports are interchangeable.  I tend to use the ipad ports to charge my Samsung galaxy tab 3 8.0 and Galaxy Note 2, use the Samsung tab port to charge my ipod touch and the Android port to charge my Bose bluetooth headset.  I find this combo produces the quickest charge for all my devices.  In fact, this one charger charges all four devices slightly faster than if I use the original chargers that came with the devices.I have several retractable usb cords I just keep plugged into the charger and when I need a charge I just pull out the appropriate cable and am good to go.  WAY less clutter on my desk vs using all the original chargers and it only occupies one outlet in my power strip - this is a HUGE plus!The only gripe I have is I wish it came with some sort of stand or base to put it on to prevent it from tipping. I do tend to knock it over but I just don't want to lay it on it's side, looks good standing upright and takes up less desk space.I am a pretty big fan of Anker products, I've bought many of their batteries and a couple of their 2 port wall chargers. All have performed wonderfully. This unit was given to me by Anker for evaluation however if I had to return it to them I would absolutely buy it again.</td><td>List(3, 4)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.3871063195895442, 0.6128936804104558))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Great product so far.. and guessing it will be for a good long time since it comes with a guarantee.

Well not very much to be honest, like most it comes with a simple on/off button and it has four blue LASD lights that indicate the level of charge so one light for every 25% of power. It comes with a USB cable and four various adaptor fittings so this will fit most smart phones, Ipads and tablets as well as MP3's etc. This is not designed for big jobs - it struggled with my Kindle but was fine with Blackebrry and Samsung S4 mini and both MP3's I have were charged relatively quickly. I received this in return for an honest review.It has a maximum capacity of 7,800 mAh and has two usb sockets giving out 2 and 1 Amp. It is nicely finished but does not have an uber quality feel as this is essentially plastic. It also has a nice built in torch/flashlight that operates by pressing the on button in quick succession. It also comes with a nice carry case which is a very welcome extra that you do not normally get. It seems to recharge at the same rate of discharge so roughly for every minute of time used will take a minute to recharge. It took about forty minutes to charge the Samsung from 28% to full power which I thought was not bad at all.It also has circuit protection which means it should not overload or overheat etc - which is also good but I consider to be essential. I have had this for a while now and one of my biggest gripes with these power banks is that some of them lose power whilst not being used. The good news here is that this one does not appear to which is also a major plus point. So not the best but a heck of a long way from being the worst power bank on the market and I intend to get good use out of this for a long time to come.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.03853615541887288, 0.9614638445811272))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Note: I received this product in return for an honest review.

Yet for my three most recent tech purchases (Sero 7 Pro, Asus X202E, Motorola Droid MAXX [XT1080M]) Zagg was nowhere to be found.I had read good stuff about Skinomi both here and elsewhere, so I purchased all three. All of them came on time.The Skniomi products are \"wet\" application. Skinomi has good application instructions, and a YouTube video to show you how they want it applied. The \"kit\" comes with everything you need: screen protector, wet spray, cloth, and a squeegee.Somewhat paradoxically, the smallest of the three (for the MAXX XT080M) as the most difficult to get positioned right, taking three full attempts (two removal and re-wetting).Skinomi recommends turning off the device and if possible, removing the battery (not possible with any of my three devices). I would recommend you also either have a small cloth towel handy, or some paper towels, to soak up what you squeeze out from under the protector. After application, Skinomi wants you to wait several hours before turning on the device. I will say that the bigger the screen, the longer it takes to dry out to a usable state.For about 12-24 hours after installation, your screen won't look right. It will seem pixellated. What you are seeing is the liquid underneath, and as it goes away, the screen will return to its original appearance. Within a day to a few days (again, depending on the size) you won't even know you have a screen protector on there.If you are used to Zagg products, the Skinomi have less \"drag\" feeling to them. On my Sero 7, there is one small area that didn't seem to ever sit down \"right,\" but it is on the black bezel part of the screen, so it doesn't affect the view. Maybe I have a stray piece of dust under there. There is also one similar area on the Asus screen, but it is up high, way off center, and seems to be getting smaller. The MAXX protector is perfect.My only \"con\" is that I would like for Skinomi to have a \"matte\" option for the laptop, because these high-gloss screens are annoying under some kinds of light.In short, Skniomi has products that are a good value, and do the job they are intended to do.</td><td>List(25, 27)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6921421677658028, 0.30785783223419716))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Tried two different slim cases and neither fit with guard off.

I personally bought them so I could have headphones on at the office and still hear coworkers. However, I require that my headset be wireless, and I haven't had wireless headphones with this poor of a connection for 4 or 5 years. I feel like I'm back to the early years of bluetooth instead of where I should be.

They contacted me later and said they have an improved version and that i was free to try it. I accepted and got the charger after a few days. It looks exactly like the first unit I got from amazon, but this time it works just fine.I recommend you try this with all your devices and pay very close attention if you have the power cycle issue i described originally. It will look like you are removing and inserting the power cable into the phone every 2 minutes. Most devices will turn the screen on every two minutes if this is happening. If this happens, your phone will probably be dead soon. do not use.Well, in this new unit it does not happen. I can charge my nexus one from 30% to 100% and the indicator light never changes from green. it shows green, yellow, red... or something like that not sure of the colours. I only see green using for one phone, so i think i can charge two phones a couple times before it run out. If it turns out to be much more than that I will update this. I will try with the tablets eventually.It was very nice from the company to send this new unit, but i'd be happier if the first one had worked.- old review -it feel solid. but when i used, i noticed that it power cycled every 2 minutes.the phone would say it was disconnected for one second.it may not be a problem to every phone (probably is not good for the batteries) but for 2 of my devices, when that happens, they light up the screen for a long time...emailed support from their website and never got a reply. went to contact via amazon and the only option was a refund. not even replacement.

I live that the back has a soft texture that is easy to grip and does not slip in my hand. The plastic that surrounds the rest of the phone frame has great surface area coverage while not being restrictive to button usage.  The cover also has enough of an overhang on the front to allow the phone to be set face down so the glass screen and the surface its set on to not touch. As a single piece, this phone case is superb.The second piece is a removable folio cover for the phone. The phone (in the Anker case) is meant to be placed into the folio and clasped shut.  The folio clasps using a strong magnet.  The phone is also held in the folio by its own set of magnets! When the phone in the case is in the folio, I'm confident it will not slip out at all.  It's a really ingenious way to personalize the phone based on mood or need.  I've used the folio cover when I have my phone in a bag or pouch, or I just use the phone case if I need to carry it primarily in my pocket.There are only 2 downsides I came across while testing this case, and both come from the folio part of the case, but neither are deal breakers for me. The first is the unsupported area around the camera hole opening on the folio case. It only has the 2 layers of material holding the top corner together, and in the course of normal usage it can get bent back, but It hasn't permanently creased (it has bounced back rather robustly). The other minor issue is the phone (when inside the folio) sliding down when pushing the power button, or sliding up when plugging in headphone or the power cord.  It is only a slight matter of sliding the phone back into position; again not anything close to a deal breaker.Anker provided me this case to try out in return for an honest review of the case, and by far, this is a neat and innovative product within a very overcrowded market.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.997978684435561, 0.002021315564438991))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I have only had this about a week and I am still trying to decide to return or keep.

I was all set to submit a return to Amazon, but figured what the heck, the packaging was resealable and it'd be worth it to try.Lo and behold, it fits beautifully - it's the right case with the wrong label.  That's the only reason I gave this case four rather than five stars.The case does NOT interfere with wireless Qi charging, at least when using it with the GooseWhite QI-ELF charger we also just bought.  (Have you noticed, new phones are EXPENSIVE even if you get them for free...)The material is perfect for me.  Slippery enough that it's not going to hang up in my pocket or drag my wallet out with it, it's grippy enough that it won't slide off a somewhat canted pile of paper (an unfortunately common thing one finds on my desk).The hand feel is very good, and in fact it's quite reminiscent of the Kevlar backing the phone comes with.  On the front side, the case slightly extends above the screen's surface so the screen is protected if you put it face down.  Unlike some other cases, there aren't cutouts for the power and volume buttons, but rather raised portions on the outside of the case let you push the buttons through the case.  I find this works far better for me than having cutouts in the case.  (When I got the phone, I bought a Verizon-branded case and screen protectors.

I received my Moto X in the mail the other day and went straight to Verizon to pick up the case.  Just like all the reviews, the case does not add too much bulk and fits nice in your hands and your pocket (unless you wear tight pants).  It's a Defender so it has it's protection points.  It gets 2-stars for not being the usual bulky Defender case, but that's it.Here are the issues:1.  There is a gap between the built-in screen protector and the Moto X screen.  You would have to press harder than you would normally do in order for the screen to respond to inputs.2.  Try to type using the letters/symbols on the far right and left of the screen are difficult because of the raised edges of the case.  It was difficult for me to highlight words click on links because of the edges of the case.  I guess you sacrifice something so when you put your phone face down, the screen won't scratch up.3.  There is an opening at the top of the screen where the front camera, earpiece, sensor is located.  Dust and dirt can get into there and get behind the built-in screen protector.  After some time, you would have to remove the phone from the case to clean it up.My final thoughts.  Case is alright but not what to expect quality wise from Otterbox.  People say they remove the built-in screen protector and purchase a screen protector to apply to the phone.  Place it back in the case and then call it good.  IMO, save money and buy a cheaper case (good quality such as Incipio), put on your screen protector.  That's what I'll be doing.  Luckily, i can still return my case for a refund.</td><td>List(12, 13)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9986740951636287, 0.0013259048363714336))</td><td>5.0</td><td>WTF? I've had this for 2 hrs and decided to return it. Bluetooth connection is easy.

Sure is... I did returned the first one only to received a very similar one. I was really ticked-off. One of their guy contacted me, named Brad (customer relations) and he's willing to resolve this issue. He sent me a new one to replaced the rather new speaker that I just received. Tell you what, still have the same static and sound breakage problem like those previous ones. He wanted me to shoot a video on different devices that we used around the house. Months later I never got around to it but yet he kept me informed on emails. Recent email he has was a new and upgraded speaker. I guess they've done and extensive troubleshoot and found out what's causing the poor connectivity to bluetooth devices. He offered to send me ONE at no cost to me just to try it out. I said in my mind, here we go again... lol. Couple days later here it was, tried it and to my surprised... it's a day and night difference. I can walk around the garage or even outside and still listening to this speaker. They made it louder too or maybe just from not having a static. I made a promise to update my take on it, so here it is. Whopping 5 star. These guys deserved it and very serious about their products and customers.

Very good customer service.Original: I love the design of this case, but mine has some defects. Hopefully these aren't common.First is the plastic back that is warped noticeably outward. So when the phone is in the case, there's a lip between the tpu portion and the plastic. There's also a less noticeable warp along the left side near the screen. Lastly, there's a very small black spot in the plastic from the factory that won't come off.Otherwise, it's a great looking case. I've got to say, the buttons work very well.

If these worked better, I'd say they might be worth $50 at most.These headphones aren't exactly comfortable. They aren't as adjustable as many others, are a bit bulky, and won't work well if you wear glasses. They also don't look quite like the picture. The pair I got was black overall, and not as impressive as in the picture.I tried these with two sources. The instructions say that they could be paired with two sources, and I had no problems pairing it with a phone just fine after already having paired it with a computer.With the phone, I had an oscillating background noise that cut in and out. It seemed to be gone when I listened to music, meaning either it dropped out or was merely too low to be audible. Since it seemed to have been switching on and off, I think the noise might not have been there. The sound with music was not of the quality of high end headphones, but was reasonable for something in the $50 range. I then tried to use the headset to make a phone call. Again things sounded fine, but the person at the other end said I sounded echoey. Considering that I didn't hear my voice at all through the earpieces, it couldn't have been a feedback problem. I was calling my car, which somebody else was using, so I know it's a \"device\" that doesn't normally echo.When I tried it with my PC, it was another story. There was no background noise, and the headphones were perfectly quiet. When I say quiet, I mean quiet. I didn't hear noise, or any sound from the computer whatsoever. The computer said it was paired to the device, and I had the sound going to the Bluetooth output for all sources.The manual said to check with Microsoft, but I can tell you from experience that Microsoft's standard answer is to check with the vendor of the device. [UPDATE: I finally managed to get it working with the PC, and it had background noise, only this time it was worse than what the headset had when paired with the phone. The sound quality when watching an HDTV program was actually pretty good, but the sound was out of sync with the picture. It was probably not the device's fault it was out of sync so I won't take off points for that, but it might be a consideration for some users.]I looked for Francois et Mimi, (prior to getting the sound working with the PC) and found a website that I believe is theirs. It concentrated solely on \"overseas sourcing and distribution,\" literally followed by a misspelling of their own name. There was nothing on the website about anything consumer related, warranty related, or support related. There were no on line instructions, no FAQ, no downloadable manuals or drivers, or even a mention of this product. It didn't even have the trademarked logo in the product's listing anywhere on the website. It's entirely possible that there's another Francois et Mimi with a website, but it wouldn't make the situation better knowing that they had no website at all that I could find.If these didn't have the background noise, I probably would have recommended them. There's a chance that mine are defective, in which case a replacement pair might have proven the product worthy.  If the company somehow changes any of this, I'll update my review, but for now, I'd recommend these only if you get them at a good price and have the option of an easy return, such as when fulfilled by Amazon.UPDATE 2: I had a chance to compare the sound quality to theKinivo BTH220 Bluetooth Stereo Headphonewhich is one of the top 10 selling Bluetooth headsets. That model was quiet and had no background noise, but the overall sound quality with voice and music was far inferior to this Francois et Mimi LD-9210. I hope they can do something about the background noise, since the potential for good sound is there.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9946543037667284, 0.005345696233271587))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I would think that making a simple cord would be easy and no way it could be bad but I was wrong.

It really looks like a phone and my better half at first glance asked if I had bought a new case for my galaxy s4.The supplied USB to micro USB is also worth noting as it's the best I've seen, rugged and flat and can be rolled up like a coiled spring.Charging involves simply plugging the USB into a power source then plugging it in. There's an orange set of LEDs which flash during charging then go solid when done. The manufacturers claim that this charger can itself be charged as you use it to charge your phone, but I would imagine that might slow both processes down but it's a nice touch to have.After it had charged it recharged my s4 from dead to full in about two hours, but i did use the phone during that period so that will definitely have impeded the process.Since this is rated 2.1amps in theory it should charge an iPad at least for a while until the battery flattens and so I hooked it up. But both it, and my iPad, got a little too hot for my comfort implying that 2.1amps as a continuous draw may be too much for it to handle. The makers do not claim this should be used with an iPad or equivalent tablet so I'm not docking a star.For the price, looks and functionality I give it five stars.

It does not matter where you are or what carrier your with. For what is now listed over $700.00 on Amazon I would expect the GPS to work. I am amazed that Amazon has hiked the price of this phone since I purchased it by over $100.00! I also started to have freeze ups and it would require removing the battery to fix it. I don't know why but it always seems that with Android phones they start off great and quickly degrade in performance and the Note 3 is no exception. This makes me sad because I really do love the size. Well it's a love/hate I guess. In any case, I will be moving back once again to Apple and the iPhone. Small screen, yes - but it's a trade off for ensured quality.

I love this product, never again will I have to worry about running out of juice.  I am so happy I did not get sucked into buying a battery case and make my phone even larger and more bulky.  I can use any stylish phone case I want or none at all.  I just put an extra battery in my pocket and 1 in my car and I am always ready to go.  Besides everyone knows that the more often you charge your phone, the faster the battery looses capacity and this is especially true if you only run your battery down to 40% every night and recharge it without ever running the battery completely out.  Now you can run it completely out and know that you have a spare in your pocket.  You only need to charge all your batteries once or twice a week and they all last longer.  One of the main reason to buy a Samsung phone is for the ability to replace the battery when it gets weak and does not hold a full charge.  These new batteries last just as long as my Samsung battery and this company has fantastic Customer Service.  I did receive a defective charger and one of the batteries was also defective on my origional order.  I e-mailed them with my problem and they sent me a prepaid return lable and as soon as I got a confirmation number from the post office, they shipped me a totally new repacement.  I received my new one by the time they received my defective one.

And sometimes it's important for me to have one handed operation. I know the phone has a mode for it, but that's not the point.Anyway...I bought the Spigen Neo Hybrid for the Galaxy Note 3 and it massified (my verb) the phone. I hated it, so I returned it less than 2 hours of owning it. So I looked for something thin. I know &#34;thin&#34; is subjective, so for me the Spigen Neo Hybrid was anything but, however this Diztronic to me is actually thin. It barely added any thickness and bulk to the phone. It does add a little, but it's not uncomfortable.There's a compartment in my Volkswagen CC that holds phones. The Note 3 fits without any case, with the Spigen doesn't. With the Diztronic it does barely.At the end of the day, I'm happy with this case. It provides the perfect amount of scratch protection along with keeping as close to stock profile as possible.

The \"older\" Iphone 5 case has a fully sealed screen protector over the entire face, including the home button.

Very cool - well worth purchasing. The unit comes in multiple colors and the one we received is black. It came with a USB power cord that we plugged in to our Samsung phone's wall adapter, and the speaker fully charged in less than one hour.The excellent instructions made it easy to pair with our phones, and pairing was quick and trouble-free.  The phone paired with the speaker was always within three to 12 feet of the speaker, typically about eight feet away, with relatively good line of sight between the two devices.Tested with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and our teenage son's HTC Droid DNA, the first thing that we noticed was how well this speaker responded to the equalizers on those phones. At first the sound seemed flat, but then we began adjusting mixer settings and the speaker jumped to life. Additionally we found that when placed with the rear speaker set down on the counter or table (so that the volume controls face straight up), the impact on bass volume and resonance was outstanding - that position turns the counter-top (table, floor, any solid surface...) into a subwoofer reflector.Through the combination of the speaker's volume button, the phone's output volume setting, and equalizer's settings - we got this speaker to produce all the volume we would need from it. Bob Marley was Jammin' in the kitchen, and I could hear him from the third floor.We played an eclectic selection including Chili Peppers, Green Day, Bob Marley and Everlast, and even a little Eric Clapton, from sources including Amazon's MP3 Cloud, Pandora and our own audio files. The results were outstanding; with a little tweaking from the equalizers for the different mixes of music, we coaxed the ARCTIC S113BT speakers into producing very nice sound for several hours. If I didn't have to concentrate to write this review, I would still be listening to the great tunes right this moment.While enjoying the music, we tested the inbound and outbound call capabilities and were beyond impressed, having never made calls through this type of speaker system before. The mechanics of the ARCTIC S113BT worked seamlessly with our phones to mute the music and enable answering, hands-free calling and texting (voice text).  I took a walk down the lane to our house and then placed a call to my son's phone. He answered the call through the speaker -- we had a couple friends over and they chuckled at hearing me loud & clear over the speaker, and I had no problem at all listening to them all respond back through the speaker. Perfect tool to use as an impromptu speakerphone!By the way - how many times have you purchased electronics and found that the user manual is just worthless? NOT the case here; the manual that comes with this speaker is very well written, easy to follow, and includes perfect examples for iOS and Android users to follow for setup and use. Best manual we have seen for gear like this, and that is completely appreciated.The speaker's carton notes that there is a two year manufacturer's warranty, so if an issue arises before that two year period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this speaker gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you go back to the speaker's main sales page, I uploaded pictures showing details of the unit, the information on the carton, and the excellent manual. These pictures may be found on that main page by scrolling down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section.If you are looking for a speaker of this style and size with all of the extra hands-free call functionality, for use similar to what I have described above, then we totally recommend these to you.Go for it and enjoy.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.528034368876306, 0.4719656311236941))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Its almost perfect for a protective case:1. when in the waterproof rubber casing, it offers some shock absorption along with the waterproof aspect2. it has interchangeable batteries (so I also added an Anker 2300 mAmp replacement kit of 2 batteries and a wall charger for $28 which gives me 3 batteries total that I can swap between and the Anker kit has an 18 month warranty with it)The total was $95 for the case and $28 for the batteries = $123 so I opted to keep this unit vise a Mophie juice pack plus (which I had gotten for $80 which was a very good price at the time before returning that unit).What I don't like about this case is that is doesn't feel that protective if just using the battery case part (the battery case parts do feel solid but will not offer any type of shock protection to the battery case itself if you drop it).I am also waiting for iBattz to come out with the belt clip that was supposed to be released ~Nov/Dec but has now pushed back to January 2014.I hope the belt clip will fit the battery case well with or without the Aqua part of the phone case installed on it - that review will be coming as soon as I can get my hands on the belt clip once its released?Eagerly waiting the belt clip - its a large case to be in ones pocket.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8776120241116416, 0.12238797588835845))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I used Otterbox Defenders on my last two iphones and really liked them.

I read a review on the Defender case for iPhone 5c, about having to push the clear plastic down in order to make it come in contact with the screen.

Sure enough, the plastic was warped away from the screen, and I didn't like it.  I returned it and then bought a comparable one by Griffin, and it has the same issue.

Why I don't like it is because I got a chance to compare it face to face with the Spigen case.  I think that spoiled it for me.  The Caseology case is a good quality case, just some things lacking compared to Spigen.  I don't work for Spigen or get paid to say this.  I prefer the have no cutouts of the rocker buttons, I like covered and protected buttons, honestly it was my fault for not noticing.  I have to admit the dual tone black on red leather look is very nice, makes the case look very clean and gives it an added style, and unique look.  Overall the TPU feel on it is a bit harder than I prefer, has a slip potential.  While I handled my Note 3 with it, I did find slipping on occasion.  It does fit very snug and nice, well protected, keeps the phone feeling slim with no noticeable added bulk.

The case itself does offer great protection, but it's also a little slick in the hand without any type of grip on the sides and isn't the most attractive case on the market - neither though, would lead me to returning the case.  The ability for me to holster my phone on my belt, on the other hand, is paramount to me and that's where the issue was.  It may have been just my case, but when I snapped the phone into the holster, it would click as it should, but with the slightest pressure, it would pop right out of the clip.  This meant, that whenever I bumped into something slightly, my phone would pop off of the clip.  Now, I was lucky enough to catch the phone before it hit the floor each time that it did this, but this is the complete opposite of why I spent the extra money in the first place on this and after that, I had absolutely zero confidence that my precious Note 3 was going to be safe going forward.  I'm about to return this case and have already bought another holster case to replace it.  I bought the Seidio case/holster combo (their highest protection case - forgot the name) and absolutely love it!  The case itself is ok, but has a design flaw that is well documented online, but the holster is top-notch and includes a spring-loaded clip to keep my phone (in a different case) secure on my belt.  Again, the Otterbox case offers fantastic protection, but the holster wasn't secure enough for me.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8835379949872908, 0.11646200501270917))</td><td>5.0</td><td>My main gripe with most USB cables is they want to return to a previous form.

But as a gadget girl, I persisted in finding a reason to need the technology even if it wasn't the galaxy gear. I googled high and low, read CNET and Amazon reviews ad nauseum, watched You Tube videos and narrowed it down to the Sony smart watch 2. What turned me on to try out the smart watch was the greater app availability, greater water resistance, and compatibility with multiple devices. But after trying it out for a week, I realized I didn't really use all the apps I added (about 12), I rarely would have it in a major water-risk situation, and I've had a galaxy phone for several iterations now. So once all those key metrics were blown away, all I was really left with was an unattractive digital watch. I found myself wishing I could quickly snap pictures without pulling out my phone and take quick calls. Soon the galaxy gear was calling my name again. So I returned the smart watch and got the gear. Wow what a difference. (Read my upcoming review of the Gear).So in conclusion, it's not terrible, but it just didn't wow me. The interface was a little awkward to maneuver and it just didn't handle the basics well. Yes it is cheaper than the gear, but if you're the type of person who gets geeked over technology, the extra bucks to get more will in the long run make you a happier technology-lover aka nerd. IMHO.

This review is a bit of a comparison of the two watches. I hands down prefer the SmartWatch 2 over the Galaxy Gear for several reasons.1) The strength of this watch is that it isn't trying to be everything. Because of that, the price is now 1/2 of what the Galaxy Gear cost and that makes this watch a very good value.2) Don't sweat the lack of camera or speaker phone that the galaxy gear has. The camera was gimicky on the Galaxy Gear and unnecessary. The speakerphone while useful at times in the Galaxy gear, is not something I miss at all now that I've switched to the SmartWatch 2.3) I think the Sony SmartWatch 2 looks better than the Gear. It has a subtlely handsome look and an understated quality feel and appearance to it. You can wear this watch with almost anything and it would not clash or draw attention to.4) I got a few compliments from women and men about my watch the first day I wore it to work. No one has any clue it's a smartwatch at first and just think it looks cool. The Galaxy Gear I thought was more eye catching in a way I didn't like or want.5) The display on the SmartWatch 2 is always showing the time. I love it! The GG has the display off until you bring up your wrist up in front of you to look at the time, then it would delay for an awkward second, before the screen turns on and you can see the time. The SmartWatch 2 is easy to tell the time at any time.6) I work in a hospital and must do constant hand washing. The SmartWatch 2 is waterproof, while the Galaxy Gear is not. I was very afraid to splash water on the GG and it drove me nuts as I don't have time while working to have to worry about drying my watch all the time or trying to protect it from splashes.7) The screen on the SmartWatch looks just fine. It's not as sharp as the GG screen, but it doesn't matter. You can easily read many rows of tiny text on the screen when receiving longer messages. Yes you can see pixels up but so what. It's still perfectly decent display for the use case.8. The SmartWatch UI acts just like Android device. There are back, home and menu keys. There is a swipe down gesture that brings down notifications.9. The black rubber watch band is very comfortable in all day use. I couldn't say that about the Galaxy Gear at all. The Galaxy Gear irritated my wrist throughout a days. Part of the metal clasp of the Gear watch band would rub against my wrist and caused me irritation. Also you can replace the SmartWatch band with any watchband.10. My suggestion is to NOT load a lot of useless apps for use on the Watch. I only install the free &#34;WatchIt!&#34; notification app, along with the gmail and text apps. The WatchIt app will allow you to send any notification that appears on the top of your mobile phone to the watch as well. I started off by blacklisting all apps so they DON'T show notifications. Then I go through and approve only the ones I want. Be conservative in what apps you allow to buzz you on your watch. It will get annoying quickly if you allow dumb stuff to bother you and buzz your wrist all day.11. You'll want the stock text message app as it allows you to view and reply to text messages using preformatted replies. You can create your own pre-formatted replies. I deleted all of the stock pre-formatted replies and created my own. When you get a text alert on the watch, you press the menu button, and then the text message icon button to reply. Then you can swype left or right to cycle between your preset replies. It works pretty well and doesn't try and shove more functionality that just won't work on a smartphone.12. The watch does what it's supposed to do.

Sound quality is great. The HS 810 would not hold a charge very long. So far so good with this Jabra --- it holds a charge while the Motorola needed to be charged all of the time.I like the vibrating feature when the phone ringer is turned off --- no need to share all that noise. As I am on call or expecting calls often when I am out at dinner, this really makes it discreet rather than missing the call and playing telephone tag for awhile.Sound quality is better than the Motorola HS 810. Jabra seems to work well for those who have small ears and their ear cells make it adjustable.If you don't need the vibrating feature, try the new Jabra BT 500 which is an upgrade of the Jabra BT 250, charging can be USB cable which is great as you will not have to take another charger on the trip!I also have the Jabra SP500 which is a wireless speakerphone and it works great vs. the Motorola speakerphone which I returned.

As previously speculated, I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit. I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that, more often than not, my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call.  My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden.  Maybe I didn't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and couldn't find one.  Maybe mine was defective, I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case. Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges!  Other colors are a bit more. Check that one out if you wear glasses.

Sent myself a voice-mail while rolling the windows up and down on the freeway without an appreciable loss of sound quality!  Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from \"all windows up\" and \"driver/passenger window down.\"HOWEVER.... I wear glasses and have a rounder face.  It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on.  The bulky part doesn't sit well on my glasses' frame.  The mouthpiece is not adjustable.  I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.  If it doesn't work well for me I'm sure one of my kids will like it.  (I ended up returning it.  See above)Would also recommend getting a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.938982243012027, 0.06101775698797291))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Searched for \"droid 3 chargers\" when making my purchase.

The poor thing literally fell apart after three months.I replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I'm pretty satisfied. First, recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users. It's pretty important that you buy from a source, like Amazon, where you can try things and return them if not satisfied. EBay may have great prices on stuff, but unless you know you'll like something, I wouldn't suggest buying a BT Headset there... way too hard to return.The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.Using the 320, I made several calls to automated numbers. All connected quickly, except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords. In that call, there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone. My old Cardo had the same delay, so I think this is a function of the phone.The fit of the headset is great for me. The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear, and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort. I've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable. Your mileage may vary.So what's not perfect? The sound quality isn't quite there. I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away. It's not horrible, but it's there in my setup. Again, your mileage may vary.</td><td>List(97, 98)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9632419665794785, 0.036758033420521405))</td><td>4.0</td><td>My job requires me to take a lot of notes while I talk on the phone.

A headset like this is mandatory for me.I've used other headsets before.  This one is really good (although I've used other Plantronics models that were more comfortable).This unit plugs into your phone, either into the external jack that some phones have or in between your phone and your handset.  When you take a call, just take the handset off the hook and set it on your table, and then push the button on the headset to pick it up.  It works great.This headset has a 300' range, which is great if you have to move around while you talk.  I've walked down the hall to pick up a print job from the printer and never had any drop in call quality.I do have one complaint about the installation though.  The jack where you plug in your handset cable is very difficult to access.  There is a piece of plastic molding in front of it.  They built a little plastic ramp to make it easier to slide the plug in, but it gets hung up on a plastic lip.  It took me about 15 minutes of messing with it to finally get the plug into the jack.

And it is locked by T-mobile such that you can't install Java applications like Google maps.I returned it, for the weight it should give me the feel of an HP-IPAQ or mini-computer but I didn't get that feel at all.</td><td>List(3, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9991971530689558, 8.028469310441471E-4))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I really, really wanted to like this phone.  I use a dialup POP account to access the web (from an old Treo 270) and bought this phone because it allows dialup IP connections where the Treo 650 doesn't.  I'd originally purchased a 650 and returned it because it prevents you from accessing the web via dialup (as soon as you put in the SIM card, it defaults to T-Mobile's GPRS network and locks out any other type of internet connection).Unfortunately, the PocketPC interface is absolutely unintuitive as compared to the Palm OS.  Where the Palm may require one or two clicks to access something or intitiate a task, the PocketPC requires you go through very cumbersome menus in order to achieve the same actions.  Learning these menus is a real pain.  Even such simple items as exiting a program or function can be frustrating because the commands needed to do so will change depending on the application you may be running (something as basic as a close box will move location from one program to another).  \"How do I get out of this?\"  one app has a close box in the upper right hand of the screen, another app. requires you to access a menu and then close.  When using the phone, turning on the speakerphone requires going through two menus where in the Palm OS it's thoughtfully placed right on your main phone screen.The slide out keyboard, although it looks cool- is very difficult to use.  Because the keys need to be flat in order to fit under the slide, they are not tactile enough to distinguish easily with your thumb, there is little resistance to activating them and it is very easy to press the wrong key unintentionally.  The stylus is laughably unusable as it's located on the bottom of the unit, is too small as well as being telescoping in a way where it's constantly collapsing as you try to use it.Where the Treo has a physical exterior switch to go into vibrate or quiet mode, the MDA/KJAM requires you to go through at least 2 onscreen menus to turn off the ringer.  I bought a 1 Gig memory card for the unit but can't seem to get it to save pix or video to the card.  I'm sure there's a way to do it, but again it requires learning more unintuitive steps & configurations from the manual.  When talking on the phone it's very easy to touch the screen with your ear or face so that functions and applications accidentally launch.  It's processor is relatively slow and there is almost always a 2 second lag between launching something and being able to access it.The WiFi does work very well and makes browsing a breeze. The screen is bright and clear.  Bluetooth is decent but sound quality suffers.  If your a techie who doesn't mind going through an extensive learning curve, the unit is as feature packed as you can get and more powerful than most other PDA/Phones on the market.  I also like the fact it uses a standard, non proprietary USB mini plug for synching and charging, making it possible to charge the unit with cables already on hand from other devices if necessary.It's not a bad phone, but needs a lot of improvements before being something practical to use on a daily basis.  After coming from the Palm OS, PocketPC is kind of like eating at Dominos after growing up on NYC Pizza.</td><td>List(10, 14)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9705481910751381, 0.029451808924861923))</td><td>2.0</td><td>After putting myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technologythrough our washing machine, I thought I'd purchase a cheap $20 replacement.

Battery life is great (about 10 hours), charges very quickly, and it's literally so light you forget you're wearing it. I also appreciate the addition of a PC USB charge cable for travelling lighter. Very nice addition for this price.I've only had it for a week and it is holding up well (you get a padded velcro carrying case too) but my initial impression, to be honest, was that it seemed a little too fragile - again it's very small and light. So I've been skeptical but we'll see how it goes and if I have to return it I'll modify my review.Pairing it up with the Treo 650 was fast and simple. It rings about 1 second after the phone rings also. The volume control on the unit is easy to use and can be turned up very loud. No complaints on the sound quality from anyone - my wife says it sounds a little like I'm on speakerphone but it's clear and understandable.Update: I had a chance to hear my wife using the headset finally and I'm very impressed - I think this headset is a keeper. There's virtually no background noise. I couldn't even tell that she was driving in the car. Absolutely amazing background noise cancellation.Update #2: This battery lasts forever - very impressed - and you really forget you're wearing this thing - it's that small and light!</td><td>List(12, 12)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.0033907433732133976, 0.9966092566267867))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Simply put, this is the best mobile phone case you can possibly buy for $2 + shipping...period!It's a very well designed solid TPU skin case with excellent fit and finish, and precisely placed cutouts for power, volume, earphone, micro USB/charger, mic and sensors.

The only thing I didn't like was having the wired headset even though the cord was long enough I kept jerking the cord during my runs pulling the ear buds out.  I needed a different solution and figured bluetooth headsets were they way but I did not want to lose stereo capabilities.  Enter the BT8010.First off, the BT8010 can be used as a one-ear mono headset like all the other BT headsets.  This is great because I can still use the headset when driving.  Unlike some of the other stereo headsets such as the Plantronics you can't wear them when driving.Then, when I need stereo for running, I just plug in the left ear unit into the mono headset.  So there is a wire but it is only behind my head connecting the left & right parts of the headset.The headset grips the ear really well so even during a run the headset stays in place.  This was what I was hoping would happen so I was very happy with the results.  And the speaker that fits into the ear is comfortable (for my ear at least).Pairing the headset to the 700p was not difficult.  In order to get stereo out of the 700p one has to download the Softick Audio Gateway which supports A2DP streaming to BT headsets.  That's just because the Treo 700p doesn't support A2DP over BT natively.Paring the headset to my Thinkpad running Windows XP Professional was painless and quick.  Now when I'm working I can stream music to my headset from the laptop and when a call comes in on the 700p it pauses the music and switches to the phone!  When I hang up on the call the headset returns to the laptop, un-pauses the music and I'm back to listening to music.  While I know most BT headsets can do this I was amazed the first time it happened.The battery life seems to be very good for my usage (40+ minute run listening to stereo plus about an hour of talk time a day).  The mono headset charges via the USB port which I connect directly to my laptop. Jabra supply a power brick for charging from a wall outlet but I don't see myself ever using it.The stereo left ear piece doesn't need charging as it picks up electricity from the mono headset via the wire.The mono headset also has volume control on it (the round silver thingy) which is nice, again for running, not having to mess with the phone to adjust the volume.I haven't had any complaints about the sound of my voice when talking on the phone.I tried to see out how far I could go from the devices and it was different for each one.  With the Treo 700p I could only go about 5-10 feet and I could hear crackling.  I could go about 20 feet from the laptop.  I was hoping to be able to go further but I guess that is just the characteristics of low powered BT.I've also tried the mono headset out in the Toyota and could hear clearly even with the noise around me.  Now I am truly wireless in all possible ways.</td><td>List(34, 35)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9974899296808529, 0.0025100703191470166))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I originally bought this for my wife's LG-VX8600 (Verizon) but like the other reviewer's noted, lot's of static unless I held the phone less than 1 foot away from the headset.I had planned on returning it but decided to try it with my UT Starcom PPC6700 (Sprint) and found that it worked great with it. I've walked at least 20 feet away from my phone before I heard any crackling. It even worked well when I went outside the room.I've never had a BT headset before but I had heard that you really need to have an \"In-The-Ear\" type of earpiece for you to hear anything above a silent room. I thought I might not like the fact that this unit didn't have an gel earpiece. I do use a custom-fitted earpiece in my job to monitor audio so I know what it's like to depend on one. But I found that this one worked very nicely without one. I was able to hear quite well in my car and other noiser vehicles. It also doesn't completely block out the surrounding noise when it's not in use. It does come with a directional condom like device but found that it was not necessary even in a loud, bare walled, cargo van (which is pretty noisy on a freeway).The fit is nice. While I do know that I have it on. It may become less noticable as I use it further. It took litle practice to get to the point of slipping it on my ear with one hand in less than a few of seconds.I think I would have preferred the buttons (at least the \"answer/end\" or volume buttons) on the side of the unit rather than the edges but I'll get used to them eventually.I haven't tested the mic in windy conditions yet but in a typical situation inside and outside the audio seemed good considering the mic is no where near my mouth. I'm not sure how it will perform when I have more ambient sound when I make a call though I've not had a problem when I used it in a grocery store.I haven't used it long enough to comment on quality of build. I hoping I can take a beating though it does seem somewhat delicate.I wish the charging port was mini USB but it's even smaller than that. Like a submini USB port if there is such a thing. It does come with a USB charging cable and fortunately I had a cigarette lighter plug with a USB port built in so I can attach the cable and charge it in my car. Unfortunately the cable is only 12 inches long so attaching it while driving isn't easy.Overall, I like the design, fit and sound. It does deserve the bad rap it got since I experienced it on my wife's phone but for me it's a great device that works nicely.</td><td>List(5, 6)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9123711302827076, 0.08762886971729235))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Easy to install and move to other cars with simple setup (can even use outside car, e.g., in a meeting), simple to use, quickly acquires connection with phone, works acceptably well (see minor negative points below); comes with both USB and car chargers (good job); holds charge a long time (weeks)Some minor negative points:1) Could use more volume, have to turn it up to max, sometimes still not enough, but generally acceptable2) Found locating the unit on the sun visor as recommended somewhat awkward some of the time, keeping mic pointed to pick up voice well, some difficulty with people hearing (depending on how much I'm using the visor for intended use - blocking the SUN); I found the included metal clip worked fine on the extruding shelf of the dashboard, above speedo/etc., better positioning of mic, easier to use without taking eyes off road; clip is padded, no worries about marking dash; works for me3) Have heard some complaints in reviews here at Amazon about microphone boom sticking in, doesn't spring out when pushed (which means you can't power the unit on); I bought a unit from a store locally to try out first, and it began doing that; returned it and bought from Amazon (almost half price)...this one hasn't done that yet, am hoping it doesn't.Overall, for the $50 I paid at Amazon, I am satisfied...not worth the $99 list you might pay elsewhere.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9463513447890732, 0.05364865521092684))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I really like these power meters, but some of them are not very accurate.

I am returning that unit (the replacement I bought reads 83 watts which is better). Some of the other units were off too, but not by as much.

I want to save you the trouble that none of these other reviews did for myself.  Most of the reviews were great so I bought it.  I have to say the sound is pretty decent, very similar if not slightly worse than my wep200.  The wep410 looks very stylish, but it just doesn't FIT RIGHT IN THE EAR.  It feels like it is going to fall out and it doesn't sit at the angle where it is pointing from your ear to your cheek, which is what the wep200 does.  When it sits at the angle it is NOTICEABLY flaring outwards.  It looks like it is sticking out of your cheek at a 30-40 Degree angle, which looks extremely odd.  I tried all three different sized earbuds, but no luck with any of them.  I can get it to fit in my ear, but the fit of the earbuds is VERY poor.  I even got my father to try this headset to see if I had deformed ear canals, but they also didn't fit him right.  I really wish I could return this, but since I have opened it I can't.  Sadly, I had to give the headset to my father.  (He doesn't care how poor the fit is as long as he can use it for hands free calling in the car)Bottom line is that you SHOULD NOT buy this headset, but you should buy the Samsung Wep200.  That Headset is excellent for the price and very light in weight  That headset is also the one you want if you like ear buds like myself.

So, we sent one back for replacement. I started using the other one that's left.

Tried this with 4 different phone same result. So, the next day we sent the second one for replacement.A week later two new headsets arrived. We charged them, connected to the phones and ... both are malfunctioning again. On one we could hear the caller but caller did not hear anything. Tried on 4 phones - the same. We sent it for replacement. The second Jawbone had such loud statick and cracking in the audio that we sent the other back the next day.A week later two new headsets arrived.

It is the best Bluetooth headset that I have purchased, as it was easy to pair, sound quality is great and the battery life holds up as promised.1. If you can, it is better to try on or look at a headset in real life before buying it on Amazon. All of these headsets fit differently. Or else you return it if it does not work well for you.

Less fancy buttons, the better it is as you can learn to use it easily and there are less moving parts to break.3. None of the Bluetooth headsets are outstanding as they are very small, so do not assume that it is supposed to do everything and anything.4. If a Bluetooth headset does not work well for you and you can not return it at a later time, pass it on to a friend who can use it.I purchased the Jawbone at full retail at an AT&T; store (and they will replace it if it falls apart and you still have the receipt)as I could not find a headset with the right fit without trying it on (they have sample headsets that you can try) and I was leaving on a business trip shortly. However, as I noted, I bought this at Amazon for my brother and he LOVES it (had a Motorola and Jabra before). He wears it every day when he walks to work and in the car when he is driving.I don't use my headset except when I travel now as I have a car with Bluetooth and my phone automatically pairs to the car audio.

(I love Prime!) The inner bag identifies it as a SPN5400A, part #11224-0817337; both numbers are on the charger, though the second is 11224-CC-0817337, and also has CHR-0291 imprinted on it. (Check the image gallery.) The outer bag carried the part #PVN1616, and a barcoded number, 760492-013772, I don't know what those are, stocking codes?As demonstrated in another buyer's video review, the MicroUSB plug has a holographic QA sticker (doesn't have Motorola logo, just a \"check mark\" graphic). The obverse of the plug has the Motorola \"M\" clearly and cleanly molded into it. The plug is molded as one, solid piece. The charger portion is okay, nothing fancy or super-solid, but it holds together. Part numbers are clearly printed on it. It also has a handy little clip on the cord (visible in the first product image) that lets you keep the cord together, either in storage or in use.Pardon the pun, but the proof is in the plug-in. As measured on my HTC Amaze 4G, this charger provides up to 800mA of charging current while plugged into an AC adapter, compared with 400mA from a similar Duracell car charger. In my car, the charger provides slightly less, but still sufficient to charge the phone while Waze is working (which uses the display, GPS receiver, and 4G network for maps). This is what I've been looking for, as other lesser chargers actually let the phone's battery drain down due to insufficient charging current. A charger that provides ~800mA - 900mA means the difference of an hour or so LESS to completely charge up, compared with a ~300mA - 400mA charger, if the phone is not in use.Because so many buyers of this and other chargers complain of counterfeit or substituted products for what are listed as OEM replacements, I urge you to buy only direct from Amazon. Ensure the transaction is covered by Amazon's usual product return guarantee, so that if you do get a substitution or fake, you can return it for a full refund, without paying for shipping. Until Amazon cracks down on sellers' misleading listings, you are really walking into the lion's den slathered with A-1 sauce when you take a chance on a third party seller, just to save a few dollars.</td><td>List(2, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9997424940942544, 2.575059057455052E-4))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have had two cell phones, but was not happy with either of them. So, for weeks I researched cell phones. I read reviews and even downloaded manuals to see what the various phones would do and not do. I finally decided to try the ATT Tilt.Battery life: Several reviewers complained about short battery life. So, this was my first test. On day one I turned up the brightness and set the backlight to stay on longer. Then I played with it by going to every program and application. I also went to all the settings and played around getting them how I wanted. I also placed a few brief calls. Then I spent a while online using WiFi. I even took a few pictures. I put this phone through its paces for 6 hours and had 17 percent battery life left. The next day I completely drained the battery and recharged it to condition the new battery. Then I put it to work again for another 3 hours or more. I had 40 percent battery life on the second day after a full charge. Of course, if I had been on phone calls most of the time, I am sure that the battery would have only lasted 3 or 4 hours. Therefore, because of my experiences thus far I would rate the battery life as fair when compared to some other smart phones. For power users they do make an extended life battery available online.Camera: Many reviewers also said the 3mg camera does not take very good pictures. This is true. Even though there are some settings to help improve the picture quality, I found that it really did not help much. So, I rate the camera as average to poor.Performance: Again some reviews I read complained about screen refresh rate or lag. I found this does happen sometimes. The lag time can be from 1 to 4 seconds. However, there are ways you can minimize this. As with any computer, the more programs you have running the more memory they use and the slower the response time. Try launching a few programs then tap on the memory icon. There you will see how much storage you have on the main unit and SDcard. You will also see how much memory the programs are using. To help with response time touch the Quick Menu at the top right of the screen and close all open programs that you are not using. Plus, wait a couple of seconds for a program to fully load before you try to navigate within the program. Also, files such as MP3s, photos and documents should be moved to the SDcard to free up space on the device itself.Keyboard: I love the slide out QWERTY keyboard. It is much easier and faster to use than the tiny keys on most other smart phones. Of course, having a large keyboard means you have to use both hands which most users do anyway. I give this feature a very high mark for convenience and usability.Microsoft Mobile: Personally I love this system because it is like my home computer, complete with a Start Menu. I find it familiar and easy to use.Sound quality: Addressing some reviewers concerns about low sound when playing MP3s, this is what I found. There are 2 sound settings. One is for the ring tones and the other for the device itself. Tap the Speaker Icon on the top right and you will see these settings. I turned both of them up all the way and launched the music player. The sound was loud and clear. I set a Blackjack II next to it and found that the Tilt was actually slightly louder.Size: I almost did not get the Tilt because of the weight. Plus, it is a little thicker that most other phones. While in the ATT store I picked up a Blackjack II then a Blackberry then held the Tilt in the other had. The weight of the Tilt was a little more that either of the other two, but not enough to matter to me. Although, this might be an issue for some that want a smaller or lighter cell phone.Voice quality: While on a call I found the sound quality clear and loud. There is a scroll wheel on the upper left side that will adjust volume while on a call which comes in handy. I also handed the Tilt to someone and called it to see how it was from both ends of receiving and placing a call. The quality was better than my cordless landline phone. I rate the call quality as excellent.Helpful hint: When on a call the screen turns off in about 10 seconds. However, you can still use the Talk key to mute the call or End key to disconnect the call. If you want the screen back on, simply press the Power button on the upper right side of the phone. Or, you can use the Scroll wheel, but this will also adjust the volume at the same time. Also, when the screen is off in idle mode none of the keys will turn the screen back on except one. To turn the screen back on from idle either press the Power button or slide out the keyboard.Word and Excel: You can create and edit in these programs without Documents To Go. Then you can either import or export them to your computer or email them. This is a great feature.WiFi: I do not text or get online that much with a cell phone. But, when I do get online then this is the only way to go. Plus, I can save twenty or thirty dollars a month by not getting the data plan. I simply get online at home or in hotspots. I also disabled the Media Net so that I do not accidentally get on line and get charged a fortune for it.Today Screen: The home screen desktop is called the Today Screen on the Tilt. I did not like the looks of this desktop at all. For one thing there is a lot of wasted real estate that could be used. The European version of the Tilt is different. I found a free plug-in that is the same as the other version and installed it. There was no editing the register, you just click on the file then reset and that is it. Now, the Today Screen is fully occupied with great looking icons and shortcuts that you can customize.Navigation: There are a few choices when it comes to navigating. You can use the scroll wheel, the touch screen or the navigation buttons on the front bottom of the phone. I also found that I can use my finger on the touch screen 90 percent of the time and with very good accuracy. I seldom use the stylus.There are a few other features you can discover for yourself. I just strongly suggest that you read the manual and experiment with the different setting to see what all it will do. I have not seen a cell phone yet that was perfect, and the Tilt is no exception. However, if you are aware of the quarks from the start then you simply learn how to work around them. Therefore, if you want a cell phone that does it all then this is a device to consider.UPDATE: I only had my Tilt for a few days and it kept locking up when in standby. It would not turn back on by pushing reset or the power button. I could only get it working again by taking out the battery then replacing it. The phone would lock up about every 2 or 3 days. So, I took it back and got a brand new one and it did the same thing. I returned it for a refund because I have no use for a cell phone I can not depend on. Therefore, I can only say that my 5 star rating was for everything I listed above, and I stand by it. However, I have to give it 1 star for reliability.</td><td>List(45, 46)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9294430834071359, 0.07055691659286406))</td><td>1.0</td><td>They worked ok for about an hour, then starting making clicking noises and cutting in and out on my headphones.

The HF2 still doesn't have the base of a Shure or Ultimate Ear, but overall I prefer the Etymotic sound.Then the not so good: Sadly at least on my BlackBerry, the microphone is terrible.  It simultaneously has low gain yet no sound isolation.  The people I call tell me that I'm muffled and hard to understand and I have to speak loudly to be heard even if I'm in a quiet location.  Forget being able to talk on these in the car or at an airport or when walking outside.  The people I call can only hear rushing wind or background noise.Another flaw is that the microphone hole is tough to get located near the mouth.  I find that I have to hold the mic up near my mouth and make sure it isn't twisted to point away.Then the terrible: I sent an email to Etymotic expressing my disappointment with the mic and asking if there was a chance that I had a bad microphone.  They never responded to my email.  I will try again, but so far I'm pretty disillusioned with the HF2.  I suppose I'll have to call them and try to get an RMA (I let the return period with Amazon expire.)</td><td>List(2, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.15937090947799462, 0.8406290905220054))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have to admit, I was a long time believer in the law of diminishing returns and did not believe in buying high end electronics for a very small incremental return. We held out against HD TV until our old TV died.  When we finally got HD we were amazed so much we ended up rewatching nearly our entire DVD collection to see everything we have been meeting.I had the same reaction when I first tried these ear buds. I was amazed at the sharpness of the high tones.  The first song I listened to was the dresden dolls and I could make out every drum beat and each key stroke on the piano rang out.  I really was like HD audio without any changes to the media or ipod. It took a while to be able to just be listening to music again, I was so impressed by the clarity.There were two big reasons I wanted these head phones. First I wanted to be able to listen to my Ipod touch on my bus commute without having to crank up the volume.  This worked perfectly, I can now greatly reduce the volume and get far more clarity than I was getting before with the buds that came with the ipod.  Watching movies is also far easier now because the isolation makes hearing dialog much easier.  The second reason I got these was to use with the upcoming iPhone 3G.  I am looking forward to using it when I get one.Here are the Pro's and Con's as I see them.ProsThese have by far the best sound I have ever experienced in headphones. They are comfortable, or at least after a couple of days to get used to the feel of them.  Once properly inserted, I had full mobility with no fears of them slipping out.  I was worried about replacement covers, but then I looked into the box again and found the two bags that contained dozens of replacement covers - very nice touch.ConsThese are the first isolating headphones I have used.  It does cause some strange internal sounds, like if you try to eat while listening to music, the chewing noises are very loud (kind of like chewing with your fingers in your ears.) Also there is some noise that gets transmitted from the cords into the ears. Also, they seem a little overpackaged, or at least the version I got. I still feel a little uncomfortable with the price, $180 is steep for me, and now that I have tried them, I'm not sure if I can go back.  But the quality covers the price difference, as well as the few cons I can think of.These are truly great. Much like the iPod it's revolutionalizing my listening experience.  I can now understand audiophyles.</td><td>List(22, 24)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9488156372875318, 0.05118436271246817))</td><td>3.0</td><td>(Using with iPhones)  I discontinued my home phone service and my wife and I just were using our cell phones.  I then heard about this type of technology that connected your home land phones with your cell phone.  Figured I would give it a try.  AWESOME!  Just unplug your land phone line from the wall and plug it into this bluetooth.  Turn your cell phone bluetooth on discoverable mode.  It connects to the Xlink easily and you're ready to go!  I read that you want the other version - the \"N\" version if you want to continue to use a land line phone service at the same time.  The only limitation of this unit the bluetooth technology.  All bluetooth devices need to be in a decent range of each other to connect.  My Xlink is in my kitchen.  I start to get a crackle on the line if the phone is ~30 feet away in my bedroom.  But anywhere within ~20 feet, the line is clear.  Thus I simply leave my phone in this general area.  When I want to make a call, I pick up any of the cordless phones I have that are connected to the base (there are 4), and I simply dial.  The phone uses the cell every time and makes the call.  When receiving a call, the cordless phone displays the caller ID without any problems.  This thing is GREAT.  Definitely no need for my regular phone service now...**** UPDATE **** UPDATE... WELL, after 6 months of use, my opinion on this has changed.  My review above still is valid... It links up just fine with your bluetooth enabled phone as I described and once linked, it works fine.  BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM... Imagine that you're relaxing by the TV and a phone call come in on your cell phone.  So you pick up YOUR CELL and answer and start talking.  30 seconds (or other random time) into your conversation, you realize that you cannot hear the other person now!  You look down and see that the phone is now connected to the Xlink.  You hopefully switch back quick enough before the person on the line gets upset and hangs up...OR you're coming home from work while talking on your cell phone and pull into the garage... and then the Xlink connects and you no longer have the conversation going on your cell.  You may be able to click over, but sometimes you don't realize that it has if you are the one talking.Well, this happened to myself and my wife so many times, that we eventually gave up and just TURNED THIS THING OFF.  I tried to keep using this for a while... but it became too frustrating!!!  I'm too far out of the return period... I wish I would have returned it when I could have.OVERALL, IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT AND MAY WORK WELL AT TIMES, BUT IT WILL BECOME FRUSTRATING FOR YOU IF YOU STILL PLAN TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE FOR A PORTION OF THE TIME.  IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS... YOU'LL LIKELY NEED TO SIMPLY PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN NEAR THE XLINK AND *ONLY USE YOUR HOME PHONES*.  Unfortunately my initial smart investment has failed and I'm out of luck.  BUT luckily I found a good alternative!

Although I have several other devices,  I have not attempted to recharge them with this external battery.  With the iPhone, I've only used it a few times, but based off of my experiences thus far I can say I really like this product!Fully charged, the New Trent iTorch took my iPhone 5 from 17% to 100%.  The second time I used it, the iTorch recharged the iPhone from about 36% to 100%.  The third time, my phone was about 17% and the iTorch charged it to about 46% before the iTorch itself was drained.  Based off of this, it seems that the iTorch may charge my completely empty (0%) iPhone twice.Recharging the iTorch via wall charger (using a separate wall adapter to connect via USB cable) seems to take about 4+ hours, when it was completely drained. This seems to be a bit excessive, but I plan to just recharge the device at night, no big deal.I previously purchased the Mophie Juice Pack Air, which added so much bulk and weight to my phone and was a true pain to get off, which I did not like any of that and consequently returned.  The iTorch is not heavy at all.  One recommendation or nice addition would be if New Trent added a short charging cable to accompany the charger (similar to GO-TRONIX 3 in 1 USB 2.0 Connect to Lightning 8 Pin, Micro USB and apple 30 Pin Connector for iPhone 4 4S Samsung Galaxy Note 2 iPhone 5, iPad 4/Mini ipod touch 5G Nano 7th).  This may drive the cost up a tad, but it covers most any device type and would be beneficial as to not need to walk around with a cord that is longer than necessary when trying to travel / be mobile. Amazon does sell shorter cables for only lightningAmazonBasics USB A to Lightning Compatible Cable (4 inch/10 CM)or mini usb as well. I would recommend ordering one of those to accompany this.

It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great.I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking.Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly.I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me.I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2...At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever.BOTTOM  LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund.  I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices, so they said their hands are tied. I'll stick to ordering direct from Amazon going forward.  :-(</td><td>List(58, 72)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9838880726797897, 0.016111927320210228))</td><td>4.0</td><td>ok look...i LOVE NOKIA. all the reviews have said great things. however on day two of ownership my LCD screen will not come on. the phone is on but it will not come on. this to me is a bad omen and i have to return it and not for replacement. im sorry. take this review for what its worth. for me i just am leary now of the model. on the plus side. yes... its really packed full of features....however i do admit that keypad is a bit on the small side. for me.... its definately loud and the graphics are pretty...i will admit that it isnt always the smoothest as it transiitons from menu to menu. i did get to download ngage games and that was kewl. and the gps was neat but keep in mind you do need a data plan of sorts in order to use it...i thought you didnt either way i didnt have anytime to figure it out before it died this morning. for this amount of money and with no tech support from my tmobile since its unlocked i simply can not take the risk nor do i want to mess with nokia usa warranty. i really wanted to love this phone...really! i think i will look at the e71 im sorry for having to post this review...i hope it was just a one fluck with my unit.in closing...it is a good phone...but i think its a bit quirky and for me...i didnt consider it an excellent phone...in fact...my nokia 6131 worked better...sorry for the bad review...</td><td>List(0, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9999084379589273, 9.156204107284764E-5))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Beware that this is lengthy!  I figure that if you consider spending several hundred dollars on a phone, the more information the better. :)The first thing to get straight about this phone is that it is not about form, but function.  It is not the slimmest or sexiest phone out there, nor does it have the most awe-inspiring user interface compared to the likes of the iPhone.  On the other hand, it has every capability that you will find on any phone these days:* A 5MP camera with autofocus, LED flash, and VGA video recording, Carl Zeiss lens, and a 1/2.5\" CCD (same as in most compact digital cameras).  Various shooting modes (macro, night, night portrait, sports, etc...), ISO control, flash control w/red-eye reduction.  Immediately send pictures via bluetooth, email, MMS, etc.* GPS with Nokia Maps application and optional voice navigation.  Various third party applications (e.g. Google Maps for S60) support its built-in GPS as well.* 3.5G (HSDPA) connectivity (see note about models below), This gives clearer voice and much faster data downloads (theoretically up to 3.5 Mbps; in practice I have seen from 900 Kbps to about 2.2 Mbps, depending on location and time of day).* WiFi (802.11g) with WEP, WPA/WPA2, and EAP/802.1x authentication (for corporate environments)* Support for nearly every Bluetooh profile in existence: A2DP for stereo audio, DUN for tethering the phone's internet connection with a laptop (for on-the road use), OBEX to send/receive files and browse the internal filesystem from a computer.* 3.5mm headset jack, infrared port w/send/receive utility, FM tuner.* \"Dual slider\" design: Slide display up to reveal numeric keypad; and down to reveal four multimedia buttons (Play/Pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).  Sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back.* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to \"geotag\" pictures with your location as you use the camera).* Built-in applictions include QuickOffice to read Microsoft Office files (DOC, PPT, XLS), Adobe Acrobat Lite reader (PDF), RealPlayer (most media files/streams), home screen \"Search\" applet to search the Internet and local content, various organizer apps (clock w/unlimited alarms, phonebook with unlimited entries, calendar w/unlimited meetings, todos, memos, reminders..), calculator, unit converter -- you get the picture.  Notably absent, though, is a Timer/Stopwatch application; however you can easily download a third party one (e.g. from Smartphoneware).* Other S60-specific applications include Nokia's Internet Radio to stream live radio streams, \"RotateMe\" to automatically rotate the screen depending on your phone orientation, \"Fring\" mobile Skype/AIM/MSN/Google Talk/etc.. client, Google Maps with GPS support, Google home screen search applet, Mobile Weather app, \"ExtGPS\" to share the internal GPS information over bluetooth (e.g. to theNokia N800 Internet Tablet), YouTube player, emTube (also for YouTube access), etc.* One of the best mobile web browsers out there.  Based on AppleWebKit (a.k.a. KTML, the web engine used in the likes of Apple Safari and KDE Konqueror), it renders web pages \"as they were meant to be\".  And unlike that other phone that claims to do the same, the N95 also has a built-in Flash Lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well.  Plus, you are of course free to download and use other browsers, such as the excellent, super-fast and bandwidth-saving Opera Mini (operamini.com).* Mail client with POP-3 and IMAP support (including IMAP-IDLE, a.k.a. \"push mail\"; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals).* Mac OS X users: Although the phone does not come with bundled software for Mac OS X, you can download \"Nokia Multimedia Transfer\" (to synchronize photos and music with iPhoto and iTunes) and an iSync plugin (to synchronize the address book, calendar, todo etc) with your Mac - both from Nokia's web site.  Also, setting up your Mac to access the Internet via the phone (providing that you have a data plan, e.g. the $15/month \"MEdia Net Unlimited\" from AT&T;) is super-easy: When you first pair with the phone, the needed WAP/APN information is pulled automatically from your Phone's SIM card.  (Ironically, this works for nearly every phone, except Apple's own iPhone; this one has a very crippled bluetooth stack, and does also not support tethering).  UPDATE: I've learned that such tethering violates AT&T;'s Terms of Service.  Moreover, there are no  plans available for this phone (or most others) from AT&T; that specifically allow tethering.  If you do so anyway, stay under the radar, and don't abuse it - e.g. by using your cellular data plan as your main internet service.MODELS:=======There are 5 subflavors of the N95 released to date:* The original N95 (a.k.a. N95-1, a.k.a. RM-159) targeted mainly the European and Asian markets; while it had quad-band GSM (2G) support for use in nearly every country, including the USA, it had support only for the international W-CDMA (UMTS/HSDPA, a.k.a. 3G/3.5G) frequency (commonly referred to as UMTS-2100).  Nonetheless, this phone was later made available for retail in the USA as well, through Nokia's flagship stores, online site, and 3rd party retailers.  It had manual shutter lens protection (you would slide it open to start the camera), 64MB of runtime/dynamic memory (RAM), and a 900 mAh battery.  Common complaints about this phone was that it would often run out of memory when several applications were open, and that the battery life was too short.* The N95-2 (a.k.a. \"N95 8GB\", a.k.a. RM-320) increased the screen size from 2.6\" to 2.8\" (diagonal), increased RAM from 64MB to 128MB, increased the battery size from 900 mAh to 1200 mAh, removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens, replaced the SDHC card slot with 8GB of internal flash, and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design.  However, the bands supported were the same: W-CDMA 2100MHz, GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz - so although it will work fine with both AT&T; Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Rogers, it does not support 3G/3.5G network speeds in North America.  Nonetheless, as with the N95-1, Nokia has sold this phone in North America as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly, this is the phone sold here (Unfortunately, Nokia's own sales channels do not normally make this distinction, and Amazon's product description is also somewhat lacking).  UPDATE: As the product description now clearly says, this is the N95-4 (a.k.a. N95 8GB NAM) model.* The N95-3 (a.k.a. \"N95 NAM\", RM-160) is the first model targeted for North America.  Most of the exterior design is similar to the N95-1 (Silver faceplate, 2.6\" screen, SDHC slot), but like the N95-2, it has 128MB of RAM, a 1200 mAh battery, and no manual slider for the camera shutter.  The main reason for its existence is that it swapped the original UMTS-2100 (WCDMA) frequency for UMTS-850 and UMTS-1900, so that it would work with AT&T; Wireless's 3G/3.5G network.  Until just a few days/weeks ago, this would have been the \"best\" choice for US customers.* The N95-4 (a.k.a. \"N95 8GB NAM\", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of \"n95 8gb\" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the \"Nokia Multimedia Transfer\" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.* The N95-5 is for Japan; it is a stripped-down version of the N95-1 (e.g. no WiFi). UPDATE: As someone commented below, it is actually for China.COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:==========================N95 vs. iPhone==============This is almost an irrational comparison, given how different these devices are:* The iPhone is almost entirely about \"sex appeal\": Polished, slim, with a large screen for viewing content, multi-touch user interface (we've all seen how to zoom in and out using finger pinches, do inertial scrolling through a list of contacts, etc).  As such, it is very big on \"usability\".  The N95 is not even a touch-screen device.  (Personally I actually prefer \"hard\" keys w/tactile feedback; having used the touch-screen based Motorola A1200 MING in the past.  Touch screens are not very good for, for example, dialing a number without looking at the screen).* The iPhone feature set is, at best, mediocre.  Yes, it has WiFi - so does a lot of other phones.  Yes, it has a \"WYSIWYG\" web browser; again, so do so many others (including the 3-year oldMotorola A1200 MING, another touch-screen phone by the way).  However, it lacks: 3G support, GPS, Infrared, FM Radio, decent camera functionality (no flash, video recording, etc), 3rd party application support (e.g. no Internet Radio, GPS navigation, etc), or even a usable Bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road).  Even the otherwise crappy Motorola RAZR line (e.g. RAZR v3xx) do most of these things. UPDATE: With the release of the iPhone 3G and the new App Store, Apple has come a long way.  It's worth pointing out though that the iPhone can still not run standard J2ME/MIDP mobile applications, only those released specifically for the iPhone through the App store.  Per the Apple Terms of Service, this means: No 3rd party web browser (e.g. Opera Mini), no voice navigation, not even something along the lines of Nokia Sports Tracker (since it uses the GPS).* The iPhone is only available with a 2-year contract from AT&T; the N95 is only available SIM-free (unlocked).In short: The iPhone is about form, the N95 (and Symbian devices in general) about function.N95 vs.Sony Ericsson K850i===========================These are the only two 5MP camera phones available for the US market.  Neither of them is offered by a carrier (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Cellular One, Rogers...), so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone.  (The upside, of course, is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it.. :)Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a \"US\" vs. \"International\" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.Most comparisons of these phones therefore center around the camera functionality (e.g. PhoneArena.com, GSMArena.com, and Mobile-Review.Com all have head-to-head comparison reviews of the two).  In summary: As far as camera phones go, these are as good as you get; they are both comparable to mid-range pocket cameras.  The k850i has an advantage indoors, because it has a real Xenon flash in addition to the LED autofocus assist beam.  However, in general, it has more \"washed out\" color reproduction than the more vivid N95; and it only supports video recording in QVGA (320x240) resolution compared to the N95 VGA (640x480).The main difference between the phones lie in other areas. The N95 is a Symbian smartphone, and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform, while the k850i is limited to running generic Java (j2me) mobile applictions.  Also, the k850i does not have a built-in GPS (but using an external bluetooth GPS receiver together with free GPS navigation software such as AmazeGPS, you can get voice navigation on this phone as well).  The Java version of Google Maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a \"My Location\" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint ROUGHLY where you are, within a couple of miles; similar to the iPhone.  Various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries, 5 alarms, etc..)On the other hand, the k850i does have a few built-in applications that are notably absent from the N95: A flashlight application (uses the LED autofocus beam), mouse/keyboard emulation to control your bluetooth-enabled computer (e.g. for presentation), and a stopwatch/timer app.One last thing to note about the K850i:  Although it uniquely supports both U.S. and International 3G frequencies, its use on the AT&T; wireless network is sub-optimal.  That's because there is an interoperability issue with its built-in media player and the MEdiaNet configuration - so streaming internet videos (e.g. from YouTube) does not work.  This was the single most important reason why I ended up returning my k850i to the local store where I bought it, after having had it for about 2 weeks.N95 vs. the Samsung G810========================The Samsung G810 was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February; it is another Symbian S60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the N95.  It will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the U.S. though -- it is lacking the GSM 850 MHz frequency used here. (In other words, it is only a \"tri-band\" phone).  Maybe they plan on releasing a US version as well - I guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not.Other than that, for better or worse the G810 has a 3x optical zoom. \"Worse\" because that inevitably leads to compromises in the optics (the thickness of the phone is the same, so that must mean that the CCD sensor is smaller - meaning more noise).  On the upside, it does have Xenon flash and a protective lens cap.Early available specs also indicate that it will have 96MB of RAM - midway between the N95-1 and subsequent N95s; however, the RAM will be split up into a 32MB chunk for the DSP (GSM and W-CDMA radios) and 64MB for the Symbian phone OS/functionality.  Thus, this could become an issue.For now, anther Samsung, the G600, although not available for sale in the US, seems to have a better camera (in some reviews outperforming the N95 and k850i), as well as quad-band GSM support.  (It is otherwise a low-end phone though, without e.g. 3G).UPDATE: Other Nokia Phones==========================Since the N95, several other N-series and E-series phones have been released by Nokia with very similar feature sets.  For instance, the N82, which features a full Xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support North American 3G bands, just like the N95-1 and N95-2).UPDATE Dec 1, 2008: The N95 now has a couple of worthy successors, each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: TheN85and theN96.  Personally, I'll stick to the N95 8GB though (see my N85 review to see why).</td><td>List(279, 286)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7388817462707408, 0.2611182537292592))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I had to return it because it did not meet my application.

After trying it for a couple of days we returned it because we were unhappy with the sound quality on the OTHER end.THE GOOD:1. It's very small and light, and very comfortable. It fit both of us very nicely, and we both have freakishly small ears.2. Pairing with the phone (iPhone) was easy, but I'm beginning to think that pairing is very seldom an issue with bluetooth headsets.3. The sound quality (speaker on the headset) was good.THE BAD:1. The only really bad thing, and ultimately the reason we returned it, is that the person on the other end had difficulty understanding what you were saying. My wife (the one using the Samsung WEP 301) always sounded very distant, tinny, and staticy. I thought it may be because I was listening to her on my bluetooth device (plantronics discovery 925), but other people had the same complaint. I frequently was having to ask her to repeat herself. WE got tired of this, so we returned it and bought a Jabra 4010.As far as comparison to a similarly priced headset, the Jabra 4010 is much better, in my opinion. While it doesn't fit as deeply in the ear as the Samsung, the sound quality on both ends is great. When my wife is using it, I can't tell a difference between her using the headset and her using the phone.If you had to choose between the two devices, I'd go with the Jabra 4010 easily...even if it is more expensive (which we paid the same price for both of them).</td><td>List(13, 13)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9601425717784976, 0.03985742822150235))</td><td>1.0</td><td>iBought Invisible shield for the back of my iPhone 3G.

It's value decreased considerably if the price is much higher.This has about the same footprint as my iPhone.  It's about a fraction of it's weight.  Build quality is excellent.  The speaker contains a rechargeable battery and there is a clear indication of when it needs to be charged and when the charging has been completed.  More on the charger and that \"clear indication\" in a bit.Pairing with my iPhone was immediate right out of the box.  I turned on the speaker, went to the bluetooth discover screen on my phone, it picked up the unpaired device, I entered the super-secret code number (0000), and it was done.Sound quality is good (for this type of speaker).  The sound is clear, there is very little (but at least some) bass, and it doesn't sound tinny.  I bought it for playing background music on the deck and it's certainly clear enough and there's definitely enough volume for that.The description implied and it should be clearly stated that in addition to working as a speaker this also works as a speaker phone and can also pass voice commands to the phone.  In fact it works just like the Motorola S9 headset except that forward and reverse don't seem to work with my iPhone4 (and it's much more difficult to wear as a headset).The AC charger is universal (at one end); it accepts 100-240V at 50/60 Hz.Now for the minor issues:There's a very bright and annoying light that insists on flashing when music is playing. According to the (well written) manual it means there's either a call or music on standby.  Near as I can tell there isn't.  This can be easily \"fixed\" with electrical or duct tape.  :)If you want to charge the speaker from your laptop or USB charger you need to supply your own mini-USB (laptop/charger end) to micro-USB (speaker end) cable.Minor annoyances aside, this speaker is a good value.  You can share music from your mobile device at good volume and reasonable fidelity while keeping said mobile device on your person.  I haven't tried the wired connection and frankly if I was looking for that kind of speaker I'm sure there are plenty available that would cost less while providing the same sound quality.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping.

When I purchased my iPhone, my first concern was how to protect it from scratches.  The AT&T; employee was nice enough to install my first screen protector and I proceeded to buy a plastic holster from the ATT&T; store.  After using it a couple of days, I decided to return it as I'm sure the iPhone's back would either be scratched or even cracked without proper protection.  I decided to get a Contour Hybrid silicone/plastic case, which didn't last 2 months.  I wound up spending a week looking for a decent case and maybe even a holster if I could find one.  This lead me to Seidio Innocase II + Holster.  I read the reviews and was very impressed.  This combo was the only holster I found where you place the phone face in and uses a hard slider case.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and so far it's holding up pretty well.  The holster is very easy to use and can be operated with one hand.  The phone/case clips into place smoothly and stays clipped in securely.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a hard yet thin case and a perfectly matching holster.The only negative comment I can make has to do with the size of the belt clip.  Be aware that this will work with most narrow belts but will not fit the newer trendy fatter ones.  I was about to purchase a new belt and was glad that I tried the holster before buying it.  Needless to say, I kept my beautiful case and holster.  Oh and the screen protector has to be positioned perfectly.  I may also have to try a different brand.

After having tried one out in a store in Singapore, I had decided to keep myN95 8GBand wait for theN97instead.  First, I was unimpressed with the keypad design, as the flat surface gives you very little guidance to help you hit the right keys.  Plus, both the N85 nor theN96are merely incremental upgrades, neither one offering the type of groundbreaking advances that the N95 did two years ago.Well, being a compulsive gadget geek, I succumbed in a weak moment.  As the price started dropping (and it has been dropping fast, and continues to do so!) I latched on.  The couple of factors that did it for me was the bright, crisp screen (and it is gorgeous!) and its smaller, more pocket-friendly size compared to the N95.  Also, I liked the new features that it offered: Tri-band UMTS (\"worldwide\" 3G), FM transmitter, a UI upgrade with \"transition effects\".I was soon taken in with the N85.  Not only does it have a much sleeker and modern-looking design than the N95 (especially the N95-3 now looks klunky by comparison), but there are dozens and dozens of little details that have been tweaked in the user interface, making for an overall more pleasant experience.One thing that came up for me, as apparently for many others, is the issue of build quality.  After having used the N85 for less than two weeks, a lot of dust had gathered underneath the display - it turns out it is not sealed properly onto the base.  I returned it to Amazon for a replacement - initially I actually ordered a N96 because of this issue.  It turns out that there were other problems with the N96 (particularly related to its slow performance and low available run-time memory), so I returned that too in favor of my second N85.  This time I was luckier, and I can now say that I have never been as happy with any other phone.My original review follows, including some reasons I had planned to forgo it; I have marked updates as appropriate.Both the N85 and N96 incorporate nearly every feature of the N95: GPS w/optional voice navigation, 5 MP camera with LED flash (though these newer models use two LEDs for brighter indoor pictures) and built-in geotagging, support for up to 32GB of SDHC removable memory (currently 16GB are largest available), standard 3.5mm headphone/headset connector which doubles as a TV-out port, comprehensive bluetooth suppport, and last but not least Symbian S60 (by far the most popular smartphone operating system in the world, far ahead of Windows Mobile, Blackberry OS, iPhone, etc - with a corresponding wealth of available applications).  See my review of the N95 8GB for some more details.  Also, both the N95, N85 and N96 are issued in a \"standard\" version for international markets, and a \"NAM\" version for enhanced support of North American 3G networks.The N85 and N96 differ from each other as follows:UPDATE: I have added the older N95 8GB into the mix for comparison's sake.* The N85 has a 2.6\" OLED screen, whereas the N95 8GB and N96 has a 2.8\" standard LCD screen.  OLED offers brigher colors, especially in sunlight, and lower power consumption (longer battery life).  That's because the pixels themselves illuminate, rather than relying on a backlight to do this.* Both the N85 and N96 are running S60 release 3 \"Feature Pack 2\", which means that they support \"transition effects\" for an overall smoother UI and interactive experience.  In particular, the N85 seems overall more \"modern\" than the older N95.  (ADDED 3/19/09)* In addition to quad-band GSM/2G (850/1900 MHz for North America, 900/1800 MHz for the world outside), the N85 also has a tri-band UMTS radio.  The North American version supports the 850/1900 MHz UMTS bands (for e.g. AT&T;), plus 2100 MHz for roaming internationally, while the N85 8GB NAM and N96 NAM only supports 850/1900 MHz.  (Conversely, the international versions of the N85 and N95/N96 support 900/1900/2100 MHz and simply 900/2100 MHz, respectively).  In short, it means that if you take your N85 with you abroad, you should still be able to get faster 3G coverage in most places where available, something which is not true for either the N95 or the N96.  (Plus, among the North American models, the N85 is the only one that also will work in Japan, since there is no 2G/GSM network available there, only 3G/UMTS over 2100 MHz).* The N85 has a built-in FM transmitter, for streaming voice calls and music e.g. to your car stereo.  This is particularly useful if your car is not equipped with bluetooth (incl. A2DP) technology.* The N96 has a built-in TV tuner, supporting DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds).  However this feature is not enabled in the North American version, because such broacasts are not available here.  AT&T;, like other North American carriers, have instead chosen to use MediaFLO for digital video broadcasts.* The N96 has 16GB of built-in mass storage, in addition to a SDHC slot.  Thus, in theory, it is able to store up to 48GB of data with the addition of a 32GB SDHC card.  The N95 8GB is limited to the same 8GB of memory for its lifetime, while the N85 has a SDHC slot (I currently use a 16GB card in it).* The N85's processor contains a 369 MHz ARM11 core, while the N96 has a dual 264 MHz ARM9.  It is difficult to say which one performs better, but both use Symbian S60 version 3 feature pack 2, which offers significant improvements in interactive feel over the N95 (which contained a 333 MHz ARM11 core).  That said, none of these have the graphics coprocessor that the N95 did, so applications (mainly games) that are optimized for this, will run much faster on the older N95.  The N95 also wins hands down in JBenchmark trials.UPDATE 3/18/09: Now having owned/tried all three, I can say that overall, the N85 is the snappiest one of the bunch.  The N96, in contrast, is quite underperforming; it even has problems streaming audio to my Pioneer car stereo over Bluetooth A2DP without hickups every 11-12 seconds.  As for interactive use, both the N85 and N96 feel a little bit quicker than the older N95.* Some people have complained about cheap, plasticky build quality on the N85 (see e.g. HowardForums); in particular, the keypad is seemingly somewhat flimsy and simply glued onto the phone.  People who have tried both generally seem to prefer the N96 on this account.UPDATE 2/8/09: With a few day's use of the N85 under my belt, I'd say it is no worse than the N95.  The keys are flat and with less tactile feedback, so it may be a little bit more difficult to text with one hand; however it's no worse than, say, the Motorola RAZR or some Samsung phones.UPDATE 2/19/09: As described above, mine had a problem with the display peeling off the base, and dust gathering underneth.UPDATE 3/19/09: My replacement N85 has been stellar.* The N85 is smaller (mainly due to the smaller screen) and will fit easier into your pocket.  UPDATE: Both the N85 and N96 are slimmer than the N95.* Both the N85 and N96 use the micro-USB standard (a slightly wider and flatter connector than mini-USB as seen on the N95) for data, and both can be charged through this port as well.  In addition, the N96 has a separate Nokia charging connector.  Now, here is the single reason I will not be replacing my N95 with a N85: This connector is at the top of the phone!  To me, this is stupid (and the only reason I subtracted a star from my rating), because it precludes the ability for third party manufacturers of docks and cradles to create one that you simply dock your N85 into for syncing/charging.  This is especially important in your car, if you plan on using the GPS navigation feature of this phone (keep in mind that when the GPS reciever is turned on, the batteries are drained pretty fast).  With my N95 8GB, i simply got aBrodit/ProClip device holder, along with a correspondingvehicle mount from PanaVise, and voila - I have a very nice little GPS device/music player/etc readily available; the N85 is definitely a bit more cumbersome in this regard.  UPDATE: Obviously I caved in and got the N85 anyway.  [...] now has a cradle for the N85 - but as I said, it does require that you manually plug the charging connector into the phone.* As always, beware of rather dismal repair/warranty service from Nokia USA (c/o PALCO).  You buy it, you own it.  You should be able to do most repairs yourself, though, with parts from e.g. cnn.cn - once available for this device.  UPDATE: Various customer accounts both here and on[..] indicate that PALCO have gotten significantly better lately.All this said, the bottom line is that there is simply no match for these phones when it comes to their sheer capabilities and the amount of features found on them.  Sure there are phones out there with more emphasis on ease of use and eye candy (e.g. iPhone), and sure there are ones with their own unique features/gimmicks (e.g. the Google Applications in the new T-Mobile G1) - but Nokia S60 smartphones are widely regarded as pure workhorses with the best overall feature sets.The N85 pushes the limits a little further, and is perhaps the phone with the most capabilities on the market today.  But if you are concerned about a solid build, you might want to consider the N95 8GB or N96 instead.  Or, wait for the newly announced N86 8MP, where apparently a lot more attention has been paid to build quality.</td><td>List(79, 90)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6730893276006669, 0.32691067239933314))</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is a beautiful smooth black leather holster with nice stitching.

I've returned the unit and have reordered the \"normal\" 510 for $10 more.</td><td>List(12, 12)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.39780728593773357, 0.6021927140622664))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I purchased this cell phone from CellPhonesCheap, which allows me to say how much I love the phone!

I would do business with this company again.  These are the best active headsets for the price.  I've had several of these headsets as well as others and I found that this is the best pair out on the market.  There is a newer model (S-10) but the reviews on it was not very positive.  The reviewers recommended sticking to this model because S-10's do not have the same sound quality as these.  My only complaint is that they are not fully sweat proof.  The reason I've had several over the years is because moisture and water tend to get in the ear buds and controls causing the headsets to malfunction.  On the other hand, I've bought other brands and they do not even come close to the kind of quality as these models.  I've had one pair last as long as a year and some last 3-6 months.  I'm an avid trainer so I sweat a lot.  I think it's a good trade off considering the other options.  I do wish Motorola does resolve this issue with future models though.Oh, and don't fall for the imitations that come from China.  I had three of them and always returned or asked for my money back.  They are cheaper but the quality is just ridiculously poor.  To combat this, I always check to see if the product is being delivered from China.  Also make sure that the product description says brand new and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).  You can also insure the headset with SquareTrade Warranties for like $7.  The extended warranty will cover up to a year after the original factory warranty which should give you 2 years of coverage.  I've also returned a pair to Motorola within the 1 year warranty period and my experience with them was very positive.  From my experience, these are the best models out their for very active and sweaty people.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7502796531262135, 0.2497203468737865))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I give this item a good rating because the item arrived practically overnight - new, in package, a Samsung brand name item...  but I thought they would work for my family's new Intensity 2 phones and they do not, so I need to sell them, since it would cost me more to return it to the seller than it would to give them away...!</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9604358040783729, 0.039564195921627056))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I bought this thing to replace a Samsung that sounded great but was a little clunky. I was immediately dissapointed by the charger that was clearly designed for some other item and kind-of-half-way attaches to one earphone. It's not a micro-USB type, but something that must be plugged into the wall--NOT your 2 USB car charger, next to your phone. The actual headset was remarkably sleek, so I kept an open mind during the eight-hour initial charging session. I was again dissapointed at once by the flat, tinny sound that finally came through the stylish and lightweight headset when I finally played the new coldplay album from my Android phone. I am no audiophile but the sound from these earbuds was really, really noticeably poor compared to the Samsung they replaced. If you like heavy deep base you are really in for a let-down. In summary, it looks cool, it's functional, I'll wear it to the gym, but it sounds substandard.UPDATE:Downgraded to one star. After listening to these earphones for an hour, I decided that the sound quality was unacceptably poor. Fortunately, Amazon has a fantastic way of handling returns and I was able to print a return authorization and shipping label--postage included--for a full refund. My first return experience with Amazon will make me less hesitant to purchase items online and more likely to choose Amazon over other sellers.</td><td>List(1, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9995368199461501, 4.6318005384985187E-4))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I had read plenty of reviews of wireless headsets.  I really wanted a headset that I could wear in the gym and be active in while still listening to my music.  I've had terrible luck with arm bands in the gym.  So I thought I'd give this a try.  I've already gone through a Motorola headset that died after two weeks.  The reviews on the Sony are positive so I thought I'd try it.This headset works quite well. The base unit is smaller than about the size of a man's thumb in my estimation.  The unit comes with a few different ear buds to switch out.  The cords do get tangled easily though.  Then again, most headsets have that problem.  The unit paired in seconds, charged well and keeps a decent charge.  On some of my songs, the sound is somewhat tinny but still good.Usage is a bit odd.  The cords are not long enough so that you could clip it to the end of a sleeve.  And if you wear it in the gym, you'll have to clip it to your collar of your shirt.  And this is a bit odd.  Basically you'll have a thumb sized bulge on or under your shirt at neck level.  I've gotten a few stares because it looks weird.  Then again, while running on the treadmill, it's super convenient.The iPhone is the bummer since it doesn't support the full volume control and track skipping.  But this unit works just fine beyond that.  I'm very happy with it.Update:  I must have doomed the stupid thing.  Minutes after I wrote this review, the unit won't power on any more.  I have no idea what happened but it's dead.  Thankfully it's under 30 days so I'm returning it.  Downgrading my rating to two stars.

I said in a review of those that I was going to try the Jaybird's, but I liked the S9's so much that I decided to try the S9 HD's instead.  I had read that the S9 HD's were much improved in sweat resistance.  Not true.On the positive, I will say there is no comparison between the S9's and the S9 HD's as far as sound quality.  The HD's simply blow the older model away.  I was very happy with them initially, although I was so paranoid after my earlier short lived experience, that I found myself CONSTANTLY wiping the headphones off to make sure they didn't get wet while working out.  Well, even that didn't work.  Sadly after only 3 workouts, these too have failed.  This time the headphones themselves still function, as well as the volume controls, however the pause, phone, and forward/back controls have all failed.  Sigh...I really do want to like these headphones, but they are obviously not an appropriate product if you want to use them for workouts.  At least they had the decency to fail within the 30 day return period!This time I actually did order the Jaybirds instead.  I know they don't have the same audio quality as these do, but hopefully they will function for over a week!UPDATE:  I looked at my review this morning, and decided that I was too harsh in rating these 1 star (although I can't go back and change that).  They really are very good as far as sound quality, and if you aren't using them for workouts, then you will probably really like them.  It's just the only time I ever use headphones is during workouts, so for me at least they are unacceptable.</td><td>List(30, 33)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9441601681583937, 0.05583983184160633))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I ordered a pair of these.

I wanted to use it mainly for in the car and on my moped. However, upon using it I was greatly disappointed! The bluetooth is very cheaply made, I cannot understand what I am paying $70 for! I tested it several times after the recommended full charge and several problems occurred: the max volume and the clarity of the call.I had to turn up the volume to compensate for the poor clarity of the call. Instead of crisp audio, what I heard several times on end was an echo-like quality of sound. It was very difficult to hear my girlfriend when I was standing outside the car in the parking lot. Another instance (while driving), I had to turn the air conditioning practically off so that I could hear my contact speaking to me. The max volume is also very limited, it had difficulty when walking by a busy park and the volume was just not loud enough. It was ridiculous! Though I asked many times how well she could here me through the line, and she said very well. She didn't even know that I was using a bluetooth- in fact she was wondering why my voice sounded so much clearer than it usually does when I call her. So kudos to the voice capturing system (AudioIQ).Second issue was the clarity of the incoming signal. The next contact I called was a mile away from me, both with Verizon and both with the same reception bars (3 out of 4). However, I could hardly hear the nuances in his voice. Not at all what I expected after reading the reviews of this product! The voices (all of my contacts) had an echoing tone and was distracting and I had to spend most of my time trying to figure out what they said than proceeding with my part of the conversation.I would also like to mention that the controls to the ProVoyager were pretty poorly designed. The buttons have to be pressed fairly hard, changing the desired position of the earpiece. A minor annoyance, but after a while, an unbearable process. And the voice command button (along the base of the boom) is a bit tricky to use. When pressed it pushes into my ear (fairly uncomfortable) and again, repositions the device on my ear.So I will be returning it for the Plantronics Voyager which costs $40 and is a lot more reliable.

What a disappointment. The earhook is so flimsy that it came apart in the first 10 minutes. I had not opted to use the earbud only (don't trust those - always scared it will come out of my ear) - and although I tried two different size buds as well as the earhook, it was so loose that if I shook my head even slightly, it came out. The call sound was average - nothing to write home about, but after 30 minutes of having to constantly keep pushing it back into my ear and reattach the ear hook, I took it off and returned it. WASTE OF TIME. I then bought the Plantronics Voyager Pro and have to say that for stability, it is rock solid- it stays on my ear very well, stays in place, and the sound is like no other bluetooth I have had - even when driving, it has loud, good, clear sound and people that I ask say they hear me very clearly and loudly. The microphone is quite a bit longer than the other bluetooth headsets out there and it actually looks like a microphone - some people may think this is a bit old fashioned but I love it - it brings the mic closer to my mouth so when I speak, I sound MUCH better - This one is a KEEPER.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9813221253653811, 0.01867787463461889))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I always used a wired headset for many years with my cellphones, as I could never find one that really worked. They were either too fragile, battery didn't last long, can't hear the other end or the person on the end can't hear me or all of the above. I bought no less than five, then ended up returning them because I was not satisfied.However, this year, headset technology apparently has seen so much improvements. I bought a Blue-Ant this year and thought it worked great. Then come along the Plantronics PRO! When I talked using this headset, the person on the end had no idea I used a headset. And I can hear them fine, just like using a landline. I am sure that is the experience you will find with this wonderfull headset. And that is the most important thing.The headset is feather-light and fully adjustable. The ear-piece and mike swivel all directions, so it is easy to fit to the contour of your face. I like the boom mike, I can make sure that fit properly near my mouth when I talk. It is not as compact as most other headset, but very comfortable to wear. It also does nothave annoying flashing blue light so you won't get dirty look from people around you. Pairing it to the phone is super simple, took about 2 minutes. Effective range is good, I can talk fine with my cellphone in a different room more than 30 feet away.One thing I found, that if I don't use the headset for half a day, it seems to go offline and I have to reconnect it (not re-pair) on my cell phone. But it is simple enough, I just touch the Plantronics headset icon on my Samsung Eternity. The manual said the battery lasts 5 days on stand-by, but I guess it is depended on how much you use it. I used it about once or twice a day, and it is still going after a week.Highly recommend.</td><td>List(8, 8)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9987848456816438, 0.0012151543183562834))</td><td>1.0</td><td>At my office, for years, I have used thePlantronics CS70/HL10 DECT 6.0 Bundle Wireless Headset System with Lifterand love it.  It fits perfectly, is full of volume and microphone adjustments and I don't notice it is on me.I have also used thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] as my primary headset with my previous Motorola RAZR and loved it.  However, when I switched to the iPhone 3GS, people couldn't hear me well anymore.Upon first using the Voyager Pro, the other person sounded more digitized than the 510.  Also, my biggest problem with this headset -- the other person sounds quiet, tinny and distant.  I tried the various earpieces with and without the felt cover, but it was all the same.  In comparing the 510 with this model, the 510's earpiece goes much deeper into the ear canal, getting the speaker deeper in, creating a better sound and sealing out other sounds.  Even when pushing in the Voyager Pro, the earpiece collapses instead of going deeper in.I had these hearing issues with the volume all the way up with the windows up in the car.  If I had the windows down, it would be impossible to hear.I wasn't impressed with the controls of the Voyager Pro compared with the 510 either.  The power button is difficult to find and push compared to the 510.  The volume button are difficult to distinguish from one another.  On the 510, each has a different slope, making it easy to know which is which.  The answer/hang up/voice dial button forces you to smash the whole headset into your ear canal to activate and it is difficult to know whether you are pressing it.  On the 510, you could hear the button being pushed or let off and you could easily counteract the force with your thumb behind, keeping the earpiece from crushing your ear.This is just not usable for me, I will be returning it.

Here I will go into more detail about certain discoveries I have made using the phone for a little while.I should probably first mention again, though, that in all honesty this not the phone for everyone.  In particular, the user interface is a bit quirky (inconsistent, and not always as responsive) - and it does take a certain amount of persistence to explore and appreciate all the features and capabilities that this phone offers.=== Hooking up to your car stereo ===Chances are that one of the first thing you will want to do is to set this phone up for handsfree use and perhaps streaming music over your car stereo.  Doing so is going to be hit or miss.First, it would not work in \"Bluetooth Audio\" mode (i.e. to stream music over the A2DP Bluetooth profile) withPioneer DEH-P7000BTunit that I had installed in my car, and which worked perfectly (albeit after a Nokia-specific firmware update from Pioneer) with my previous two phones, the Nokia N85 and Nokia N95 -- though it worked fine as a handsfree unit in \"Bluetooth Telephone\" mode (over HSP/HFP).I went through several car receivers (both buy/return and in store) to get one that actually worked:* ASony MEX-BT2700(works fine, nice intuitive controls, but inferior sound and also inferior handsfree pickup),* AClarion CZ509(complex controls -- I had to download the user manual on my N97 right in the store in order to figure out how to pair it; would only work in \"Blueooth Audio\" mode and NO SOUND would come through in handsfree mode)* AnEclipse CD5030(very nice unit, good sound, integrated steering wheel controls for Toyota and Honda; but same problem as the DEH-P7000BT: No A2DP/AVRCP with my phone)I skipped on Kenwood, because from prior experience using a KDC-X492 along with a KCA-BT200 adapter, there was a delay from when Bluetooth Audio were initiated from the phone until it was heard over the speakers. This may seem like a nitpick, but I also use my phone as my GPS/navigation system - and the result was that instructions like \"In 400 yards, turn left\" would become \"n left\". No dice. The Pioneer unit, at least, did not have this problem.I did finally find something that works for me: A newer Pioneer unit, theDEH-P6100BT.  From my original unit, I also knew that this one has excellent sound quality and controls (good dynamic range, good sound shaping features, etc).  The one problem I'm still having though is that each time this unit connects to my phone, it initially gives me only \"handsfree\" functionality (not stereo audio). I need to manually go into the menus EACH TIME and enable A2DP and AVRCP (that's quite cumbersome), OR start playback from my phone (in which case A2DP, but not AVRCP is enabled automatically).  In other words, getting my steering wheel controls to do what they are supposed to do - control the playback - is usually more hazzle than it's worth (except for longer trips).All this said, a Bluetooth-enabled stereo is not necessary with this phone.  If you have an auxillary input or a tape deck in your existing car stereo, you can hook up to its 3.5mm jack using a standard auxillary cable or a cassette adapter.  You should then dock your phone close to your driver's seat (I use aBracketron Grip-ITholder until a N97-specific holder is available from ProClipUSA), since you'll be using the internal microphone when making calls.  (I actually got better sound as well as better handsfree pickup with this setup and my factory stereo compared to the Sony I mentioned above).  You will need to use the phone itself to control music playback (as opposed to the receiver or steering wheel controls) - but that's why there is a \"Music Player\" widget available for the home screen.EDIT: If you read the N97 specs carefully, you also know that it (like the N85 before it) has an FM transmitter.  I did not even bother to mention this initially, because quite frankly, I don't see the point.  It is far too weak to produce the signals required for your typical FM receiver, even as the antenna is fairly close.  All you get is static.=== Tethering (phone as modem) ===A little known fact about GSM/GPRS-enabled phones (except the iPhone) is that they can be used as a modem for your laptop orother device, e.g. while on the road.  You can connect via a USB cable (one is included in the box) or Bluetooth.  In fact, if you have a Mac from the last 3-4 years (e.g. MacBook Pro), it will automatically set up this modem connection when you pair it with your phone (There is a checkbox that says \"Access the Internet with your phone's data connection\").  For Windows, you can download modem drivers from Nokia's support site.You will need an Access Point Name (APN) from your cellular provider, as well as a dial-up number (often optional), username/password (ditto).  This information is readily available on the Internet.  It should be noted that such tethering is NOT included in the price of many data plans, unless they specifically state so (this is why it is not enabled in the iPhone as sold in the US) - and it certainly would not be wise to use this as your main internet connection.  I find it invaluable for light web and e-mail access on the occasional road trip though.=== Downloading Applications ===The N97 comes with a number of third party applications preinstalled, including JoikuSpot, which allows you to turn your phone into a WiFi access point for internet access; Adobe PDF, QuickOffice, and even an Amazon app.  But of course one of the primary joys of owning a smartphone like this one is being able to continuously explore new applications and uses.The N97 runs the \"Series 60\" User Interface, 5th edition (a.k.a. S60v5) on top of the Symbian operating system version 9.4.  S60v5 is the first version of this platform to support touch-screen input, and this is only the second phone from Nokia to do so; previous N-series devices (such as the N95, N96, N85) all ran on S60 3rd edition.This means that even though the N97 represents a new type of device for Nokia, it is mostly capable of running applications that were written years ago.  Many of these are being updated for the new touch platform, to be sure, but the main outcome of this backwards compatibility is that you will find some pretty esoteric stuff out there.  For instance, I make frequent use of Salling Clicker - an application that lets you use your phone as a remote control for your (Windows or Mac) computer (over Bluetooth or WiFi), e.g. media/music control, powerpoint presentations, etc., even though that application is not specifically written for the new platform.  I also use the PuTTY telnet/SSH client, which HAS been updated to take advantage of the new touch screen, but otherwise was developed long before the N97 (or even the iPhone).  Then there is Nokia SportsTracker - always invaluable; keep it open while you go jogging, biking, etc; you can later view your route superimposed on a map, speed plots and summary, and even what music you were playing at various times.In addition to Symbian/S60 specific applications, and like most (non-US made) phones, the N97 can run \"generic\" mobile applications written for Java (J2ME).  For instance, Opera Mini is an excellent and super-fast web browser that can run on most mobile phones (not the iPhone, Palm Pre, BlackBerry though) -- thanks to its use of proxy servers that compress the traffic sent over the air to your phone.  I myself got a kick out of a HP 45 calculator emulator I found recently, which uses the original HP45 program code and even has a picture of it. :)As you can guess, the applications that you can download for the N97 are not concentrated in one location, as they are in the iTunes App Store for the iPhone.  This is a fact that Apple exploits very well in their own marketing - and to be sure, discovering or searching for applications is unfortunately quite a bit more cumbersome for Symbian/S60 than for the iPhone.  On the positive side, that means that there is no central control (you know, where someone decides that there shalt be no third party web browsers, mail readers, or GPS/navigation apps).  In fact, it is this very open architecture that allows the \"write once, run everywhere\" paradigm of the J2ME platform, whereas Apple, RIM/BlackBerry, and Palm/Pre are only capable of running applications that are specifically written for those devices.Now, Nokia has had a \"Download!\" service for years, and have recently opened an expanded application store, the \"OVI store\".  The content is still somewhat meager in both places; moreover, as I found by trial and frustrating error, once you have purchased and downloaded an application from the OVI store, there is no way to re-install it (should you happen to uninstall it at some point).  I was attempting to get a newer version of RoadSync (a Microsoft Exchange client with very decent HTML support) working, but because it got into a state where I wanted to re-enter my Exchange Account information, I had to reinstall.  (This is also an issue in RoadSync -- there should be a way to reset the information without having to uninstall/reinstall).  However, the original installation package was never saved on my phone, and there was also no way to download it without purchasing again.  For me it was thanks, but no thanks - both to RoadSync (poor design) and OVI store (poor design).The bottom line is that if you expect to be fed with a teaspoon from a central app store, then maybe the N97 and Nokia's infrastructure is not for you.=== Cohabiting with the Mac ===The N97 comes with software for Windows, but not for the Mac.  Well - that's standard fare.  Unlike most mobile phone manufacturers, Nokia have at least developed software for the Mac. :)You will want to download two things from them for ANY of their phones: Nokia Multimedia Transfer, and an iSync plugin.Nokia Multimedia Transfer is a background application (access it via a little menu bar applet) which allows you to, well, transfer multimedia between the Mac and your phone when connected via USB (using the \"PC Suite\" mode on the phone).  It imports captured photos and movies from your phone camera into iPhoto, synchronizes selected playlists between iTunes and the phone (transcoding any movie files that are not natively supported on the phone in the process), and allows you to synchronize web bookmarks between Safari and the phone's browser.The iSync plugin WOULD let you use iSync on the Mac to synchronize contacts, calendars, and todo notes with the phone.  Unfortunately, almost a month after initial release, there is not yet any such plugin available for the N97 -- frustrating since they already have one for the N86 MP, which has not yet been released here.  In the meantime, you can at least transfer contacts from your Mac Address Book to the phone: Select all contacts (Command + A), select File -> Export -> Export vCard; transfer the resulting \"vCards.vcf\" to the phone (E:\\Other\\Contacts), then open \"Contacts\" on your phone to select \"Options -> Copy business card -> From other memory\".How to do the latter, you ask.  Well, once you have paired your Mac with the phone, you can browse the phone filesystem from your Mac by clicking on the little \"B>\" (Bluetooth) icon in your menu bar, then selecting the phone, and then \"Browse device...\".  You can also simply send files from here, or from right-clicking on the file itself and selecting: More -> Send &lt;filename> to ...Finally, as mentioned above, you can use your phone as a modem by simply pairing it over Bluetooth.  Or, you can plug in the USB cable, then open the \"Network\" System Preferences pane.=== The Copy/Paste snafu ===Unlike previous S60 phones, there are no keypad shortcuts available for Copy/Paste on the N97.  Instead, you need to access these functions in the menus (\"Options -> Editing Options\" in most places).  The problem is that not every input field has such a menu available!  For instance, if you are entering settings for a new e-mail account, or the WEP/WPA/WPA2 key for a wireless access point, you are working inside a pop-up dialogue box with no menu available.Ridiculous as this sounds, in these places you actually need to CLOSE the keypad, then tap on the input field in order to bring up the virtual numeric keypad, as if you were using multi-tap or T9. On the top of this screen there is a context menu -- if you first drag to select the text you want to cut/copy, then those two options are available in that menu; if there is text in the clipboard, \"Paste\" is available.Or, you could use aBluetooth keyboard-- more on that below.  In this case, Ctrl-C/X/V works as expected.=== Laptop/Netbook Replacement ===You laugh.  Go ahead.If you are an owner of any other recent N-series device (N95, N96, N85), you already know that it can hook up to a TV using the included TV-Out cable, CA-75U.  Well, the N97 does not come with such a cable, but you can order one separately and it still works.Also, while the N95/N96 come with a \"Wireless Keyboard\" utility pre-installed, it is not included in the N97.  You can download and install it from Nokia's web site though; go to the support pages for their own SU-8W keyboard.  It will complain that the application is not compatible with this phone, but it will work anyway.So, there you have it.  QuickOffice is already pre-installed to allow you to view Microsoft Office documents - you can purchase an upgrade that allows you to edit these documents too.  Adobe Reader LE is also installed (though note that unlike on previous phones, it is now only a trial - you have to buy it after 2 weeks or so..).Personally, I access remote UNIX hosts over SSH using PuTTY.  Obviously you can also do web browsing, mail reading (incl. Microsoft Exchange), etc.=== Reaching Nerdvana ===Just to be exceptionally clear on this point if you haven't figured it out yet - this is a phone for geeks.  People who follow Boy Genius Reports, for instance, best stick to their iPhone and the eye candy that is afforded them there.  It takes a little bit more persistence to appreciate S60 devices like the N97 - but in return, it will grow on you for a very long time as you keep finding new features and new ways to use it.  For starters, the sheer wealth of hardware that exists on this device (5MP camera with flash and video recording, GPS, 640x360 pixel screen, pull-out keyboard, a hundred different types of sensors including electronic compass, accelerator and proximity sensor) are just ripe for new sorts of applications.</td><td>List(4, 7)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9158795197650569, 0.08412048023494305))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Shipping was prompt and courteous for this item.

I returned it (in the same box as my roomates, whose mophie also stopped working at the same time) and received a new one, no questions asked, which is nice. But the new one barely works at all. It extends the life of my iPhone battery for an hour or two but doesn't charge the phone, and it doesn't seem to work if my phone battery drops too low. For example, if my phone is at 20%, I attach the case and where I would normally only have maybe 30 min of talk time, the mophie gets me 60 minutes, but then the phone dies, even though the mophie power meter says it has juice left.

I received a different pair as a gift for Christmas and loved how they could be applied to my daily life, but they were an in-ear variety that had poor sound quality and was simply uncomfortable to wear.So, i returned them & began shopping around for a decent mid-range over-ear set when I found these. The reviews were glaringly positive & I see why.Sound Quality--I'm a musician, so I have fairly well trained ears. I certainly didn't expect studio quality sound from a $40ish pair of bluetooth headphones. However, the performance and sonic quality of this item greatly exceeded any of my expectations. They sound fantastic and are perfectly acceptable for any casual listener.Microphone Recording Quality--I use Siri quite a bit on my phone & haven't had any problems related to poorly received voice commands. In voice calls the worst people have said is &#34;You sound a little different, but you sound fine.&#34; Again, perfectly acceptable for my standards.Weight--Very light weight. Zero complaints.The Fit--This is wildly different on an individual basis, so I can only relate my experience. I have a bit of a large head and wear glasses. Naturally the concern for anyone with glasses is feeling like you have a pile of stuff pulling down on your ears. These absolutely DO NOT interfere with my glasses. However, I have rather thin framed specs so it allows for plenty of extra room on my ear. That being said, even with thick emo style frames I think these would continue to work without bothering you. I even wear them with glasses while jogging on the treadmill without problems.Cell Phone Integration-- I absolutely love how well this headset works with my phones. I actually use an iPhone 5, but also have an older Evo 4G on hand. It works extremely well with both phones. It syncs quickly and easily, and the right-earphone has 4 well-disguised buttons for call/accept call, skip forward, skip back, and play/pause. All functions worked perfectly on both android and apple platforms. As a pleasant surprise I tapped the call button on my iphone while it was in a standby state. I was delighted to hear the little Siri sound blip in my ear & mic channel open to accept a voice command.Battery Life-- I've used this headset for roughly a half hour a day for a week & still going strong. It advertises 4-6 hours of use & I am inclined to believe it. It seems perfectly acceptable given the fact that this lightweight set of headphones cannot have a large battery in them weighing them down.Range-- Once again I was blown away by the performance. Last night I let my daughter play on my phone upstairs while I played with these downstairs. When I powered them on I was shocked when they connected to my phone 20 yards away through an entire floor's layer of construction. I can basically leave my phone anywhere in my house and simply keep my headset on. VERY nice for those times when you forget to stuff your phone in your pocket before walking away.Final Impressions-- I think what will make or break the use of this product for someone is simply the question of &#34;Does it fit your head?&#34; Beyond that, there's really nothing more you could possibly ask for given the dollars you'd be spending. I am sure there's a pair out there with slightly better sound or an extra button or two, but for the money you simply can't beat these.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.4317385427017151, 0.568261457298285))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I used these for the whole time I had my samsung phones,great price & easy to apply some bubbles as usual but still looks and works fine for 10% of what they cost in the store.I always buy my screen protectors from Amazon as the price and quality are 2nd to none.I write alot of reviews on Amazon and there are more I should as I have been buying from Amazon for years and literally hundreds of products from screen protectors to Tvs and always get a good product and have yet to return anything.And no I dont work or in any way receive anything from Amazon except what i pay for.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9542299565222574, 0.045770043477742474))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I got this for my galaxy s3 since i didn't want an in-ear headset and it worked like a charm.

I give it a 9 (would have given it a 10 but because of the button and fit..see below)I gave it 5 stars above because I feel my gripes are personal and not because of the product.After 2 weeks of use, I am amazed at the quality of this little bluetooth. Sound quality is great. Both sides of the call are hard pressed to know you are on a headset. Mic and speaker are crystal clear. Volume is loud and clear. My only gripes are the ear hook and button. The ear hook can become uncomfortable after an hour or so of wear. I consider myself to have larger ears and know fit will be different for everyone as no two ears are the same. As for the button...the main multipurpose button is a tad hard to push. Its hard to tell if it was tapped or not, so then you try it again and find out you are in your phones voice assistance mode. But its early, and could just be a learning curve to get use to. All in all a great product. I ended up buying another for a friend. Almost forgot, the best feature is the sliding on/off switch. Tired of others having teeny buttons that need to be held for 5-10 seconds. With that time lag, one cannot turn on the headset and the phone is ringing because it wont connect in time. With the Samsung, when your phone rings, flip the switch to on and you are connected by the 3rd or 4th ring. Very fast!***UPDATE 1/5/2011***Still using this headset as my everyday bluetooth. Still works like day one and still very happy with it. Sound is loud and clear.

In several areas I will compare it to the iPhone, since I feel that these are the two best multimedia smart-phones currently available.POSITIVES:1. Awesome Operating System (WebOS) and most positives come from it.2. Multi-tasking is simply perfect, switching between apps, opening new ones, closing them, everything works great. Want to listen to Pandora online radio while surfing the web? No problem. The iPhone 3GS does not have that functionality.3. Instant Messaging and text messaging is awesome. Hard to explain but a text from a friend, as well as an instant message later from that same friend all go to the same messaging interface and are linked as part of the same conversation - it's simply brilliant and seamless.4. Phone is comfortable to hold and has a nice curve to it.5. Contacts from Facebook and other email accounts are seamlessly added to the phone automatically.6. Push (instant) email from other accounts.7. Awesome touch screen, really vibrant, gestures work well, surfing the web is a breeze.8. Finally, a little known gem, that I don't understand why more people haven't lauded it: Navigating applications is simply brilliant. No other device does it this well. Need to \"up\" one level (say from the compose an email screen to your inbox, just swipe your finger on the bottom of the screen (\"back\" gesture) and it takes you there. Every application, even 3rd party ones, work this way. Listening to a particular song in an album and want to go back to the listing of all songs in that album? Yes, the back swipe does it again. Again, it is hard to describe in words, but it is simply intuitive an really easy. In the iPhone for example, every application has its own way of doing this. Some have a back button, some have a menu that gives other options, some have links in other areas. Basically, navigating an iPhone app is an adventure, and not intuitive. Moving around a WebOS (pre) app, is incredibly easy.9. Sprint plans are cheaper than AT&T;, period. (69.99 gets you 450 minutes, unlimited data, unlimited text messaging in Sprint, and turn by turn navigation with traffic reports, re-routing the full service. This plan is 99.99 in AT&T; (for 99.99 in sprint you get unlimited MINUTES, data and text). If you don't care for navigation, the cost in AT&T; is $89.99, still a full $20 more ($500 more throughout the life of the contract.10. You can replace the battery (albeit it's a bit hard, but you can do it)NEGATIVES:- The device is fragile. It's all plastic, including the screen. iPhone screen is glass and the new 3GS is much better with finger print smudges. If it falls, it's probably going to be toast. The iPhone (1st generation through 3GS has MUCH better hardware - not talking about processor and memory, those are virtually the same between 3GS and Pre, but the case, screen, and overall physical feel of it.- Finger print ultra magnet. I still do not get this. Why not normal plastic? This is just baffling. You will see every finger print, everywhere on the device, back, front, sides, every inch of it is a finger print magnet. It's annoying. Instead of shiny coat of black finger print magnet plastic, use the regular one? Like every keyboard in the world?- Very few applications on the store. More will come, but right now (August 3, 2009) there are only about 40.- Battery life is very poor. You will have to charge every day, even with light use. Reports vary widely, some people say they can go 2 days, but the overwhelming majority of users report less than a day worth of battery. Just google \"palm pre battery issues\" for details. Mine lasts around 20 - 30 hours. That's about 20 texts (combined sent and received), about 5 - 10 minutes of phone calls. Email checking, with some responses, light web surfing, on both evdo and wifi (total time about an hour). And listen to mp3s for about an hour or two. Most of the time I am not doing heavy multitasking, just music and web, or music and email. I have the GPS off, location services off, email syncing is every 24 hours (instead of instant/push), and the screen brightness is at the lowest level. Despite all this, I have to charge it every day. If you use the navigation application to get somewhere that is over 3 or 4 hours away, your phone will be dead by the time you get there, so a car charger is a must for those times.Other notes:Keyboard:It is small (I have large hands and relatively fat fingers, can palm a basketball). At first, I thought I would never be able to use it, since the layout of the phone calls for you using both your thumbs to type (and thumbs are of course, the fattest of all fingers), so I made lots of mistakes, and thought I'd return it due to that. But after about a month I got used to it, and accuracy is up to about 95% or so. I can't say I love the keyboard, but it is not as bad as some reviews make it sound.Sharp / cut cheese?Some professional reviews complained about how sharp an edge of the device was. This is incredibly misleading. I have never, in 2 months of use, felt the \"sharp edge\" against me on regular use. Not sure how the reviewers managed to feel that after a day or two with the device. If you open the device, and press your finger directly on the edge, you can see that it is indeed a little bit sharp (no, no chance at all of cutting yourself) but I cannot think of a single way of touching the sharp edge during normal use. Let alone touching it hard enough for it to feel sharp.-------------- My Screen Cracked (skip if desired): ---------------------------The screen cracked on the top right corner (spider web cracks - just google for palm pre cracked screen to see the reports and pictures) of my phone. I have no reason to lie to you about it. I did not do ANYTHING for it to break. It wasn't dropped, it was in loose pocket, I didn't bump into a table. I simply tapped that corner (when tapping the top right corner the phone displays the remaining battery life in percentage, among other data), put it in my pocket, 5 minutes later I took it out again, and half the touchscreen was unresponsive, then I noticed the crack right where I tap to get battery life. I was shocked. Never in my life have I broken a gadget (and I have had tons of gadgets, from pdas, to cellphones, to small computers, digital cameras, you name it). This was after 18 days with the phone, so I figure since I was within my 30 days, all was well, and the phone would be replaced - I had to have gotten a lemon, right? Note: the phone was immaculate in every other way. There were no scratches, no dents, in fact the crack was in the middle layer if the display (meaning you couldn't feel it with your fingers) but the touch sensitive layer was messed up somehow.- Sprint store reps were rude and accused me of dropping the phone, sitting on it, or elsewhere, and would not replace it. Take it to repair and pay $119 was their solution.- Palm (via the phone) were just as unhelpful and said: \"the screen is very resistant, you must have done something to it\". They wanted $200 to replace it. After talking to about half a dozen employees (mostly in India - which is fine with me, just noting it that customer support is not US based for the most part) I got a higher up in the US. He was pleasant, but still refused to help much. He just said, we can repair it for a discount (making the repair $100 instead of $200). Even after explaining that I must have gotten a lemon, to no avail. He did mention that if the crack was in the \"home button\" (bottom of the phone) then they would have replace it, as that is a known issue, but since my crack was in the upper right, something must have happened with the phone.- Now I started calling Sprint again to see what they could do, paying $119 or $100 for a lemon just didn't seem right, so finally after x amount of time and countless conversations, someone gave me the benefit of the doubt (you would think they would treat their customers better, but alas) they offered to credit my account after I sent them a repair bill from a designated repair store.Why did I stick with Sprint and a Palm phone after this? I like the phone that much. And Sprint did pay for the repair at the end. If they hadn't I would have canceled the contract. But the customer service of both Sprint and Palm was very poor to say the least.- I've had the new device for about 20 days without issue, but I am worried it will happen again. The Sprint insurance is also pretty bad for regular damage (lost or stolen, different story), you pay $7 a month (which is fine...) but if the screen cracks, you then pay $100 for the repair. The repair without insurance costs $119. So if you don't plan on breaking it more than once every 3 months, it doesn't seem very worth it.------------------------Conclusion:Despite the negatives, I love the phone. I had the option to get an iPhone 3GS instead, but after using this for a month, I just couldn't go back. The iPhone 3GS seemed so primitive in a lot of ways.</td><td>List(68, 74)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.43405383549532295, 0.565946164504677))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Let me start by noting that I first tried aPowermat PMM-HO100 Home & Office Mat (Black)and ended up returning it. I really liked the idea of this new and greener technology (to my thinking, myGrid takes less energy by using magnetic connections to one AC outlet over separate power cords to an AC outlet for each device) so I decided to try this one.It is easy to set up: plug the myGrid into an outlet, place your items into the required holders, place them face up onto the mat, watch for the light which ensures it is working properly and wait the usual time for your item to be charged.LIKES: (1) love that this can charge up to 4 electronic devices - this is the highest I've run across in charging mats; (2) the holders are fairly easy to fit onto and remove from your cell phone which is a HUGE plus when you are talking about expensive devices; (3) the cost of additional holders are the same - $34 - for all devices where others charge more for premium brands like iPhone & Blackberry.DISLIKES: (1) this is not an easily portable device; (2) at this point, has limited brand compatibility; and (3) it can be more cumbersome to fit certain cell phones into and out of a holder to charge instead of using the original charger.Like all others in this category, it works for certain cell phones and not across the board. I am hoping that myGrid will branch out to include more brands to make this a better option. You will need to invest in additional holders/power sleeves so note that the end cost is higher (I would estimate at least $120).If you want the latest in technology, this is a good choice.  I like it but I am not completely convinced and am still keeping my old charging cords.</td><td>List(0, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8620552336443141, 0.13794476635568584))</td><td>1.0</td><td>This case should not be on the market.It honestly is not worth a quarter.The case is so thin and flimsy.The rhinestones are barley attached.Before I opened it, I could see there were missing rhinestones already.I returned this the next day.DO NOT BUY!</td><td>List(4, 4)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.11086180524779113, 0.8891381947522088))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Im female but I LIKE THE PHONES.

I'll change the rating depending on next update - length of wait will be factored in. I see a lot of bashing for people who give low reviews so I expect I'll hear about this.I'll start by quoting Nokia from bug 6766 regarding bluetooth problems on the phone. This came after the major PR1.1 update:\"As far as making all issues go away, I don't think that's physically possible since Bluetooth and WLAN share the same antenna in the N900. Some WLAN operations, such as searching for access points, take over the antenna almost completely.\"All the bluetooth bugs still exist, some are made worse by PR1.1.Note: regardless of what people say, there is NO way, zero, none, nada, to turn off the wifi radio via graphical interface. You can probably do so via CLI if you are very advanced with Linux and not worried about re-flashing, but that's not practical. You can take several steps to make it \"less active\", but it is still running - easiest to see is choose \"Internet Connections\" from the status area and it will show all wifi APs even though you think it is disabled. Nokia closed an enhancement request to allow customers to fully disable the wifi radio as WONTFIX.The major update of the two, known as PR1.1, was eagerly awaited and expected to fix a lot of problems including the well known, very active, bluetooth bugs. Nothing I listed has been addressed and the firmware addressed a few minor things overall-nothing major. Important to note that the manifest list posted for PR1.1 lists A LOT of bugs as fixed that were actually fixed before the phone was released. I have noticed a lot of people's tones have changed since the disappointing update.PR1.1:Bluetooth: The PR1.1 update did help some who had a lot of issues with 'stuttering' on bluetooth (music and calls). For most of us, it didn't. One person who initially seemed happy and said he'd live with it came back a day or two later and said it's not fixed. Long story short, read bug 6766 on maemo's bug site. For me and others, PR1.1 has increased disconnections to a point that I don't bother trying to use BT now. It essentially disconnects immediately. When I was testing PR1.1, a couple times the connection lasted several minutes, but the majority is instant disconnect. If you need bluetooth, I would hold off.Portrait mode: They are working towards it, that's good. The browser has a partial implementation now (it's nice for one handed reading, good formatting, but not complete). Tip: you have to hit a combination of shift+ctrl+O to activate it; it works with keyboard slider in only. To disable, shift+ctrl+O again. However, I have 'remnants' of the future with my desktop sticking in portrait randomly requiring a restart. Not a huge deal unless you are in a hurry to make a call.USSD codes: The *#nnn#nnnnnn# to do many controls on your phone like say, enable full forwarding since it is not available in the interface or check prepaid balance, etc. etc. They fixed a couple codes: show your IMEI and show the software version (both available in settings | 'about phone' right next to each other). They closed this bug as fixed - a lot of very unhappy people on this one. I think Nokia (well, probably Maemo since they don't know phones yet) really underestimated how important this is - it is clear from the huge bug thread that a lot of the codes people need are surprising to them.Maps: It starts up a little quicker. A few minor tweaks that aren't worth mentioning. I was hoping I could at least do routing to an address. You can, but open your browser and go to google maps.Anything else I don't mention, there is nothing to mention. It was an underwhelming update that decreased battery life further, addressed several small issues. Some had ZERO votes and only 1 person involved with the ticket and it was very small - e.g. RDS name in the FM transmitter???. Clearly poor prioritization.Other stuff: The battery charges much faster now, but it also drains much faster. There are some great apps starting to show in the pipeline. A lot of hard work from the community going on and new things are showing up daily in devels and testing repositories. They just aren't hitting extras (production) fast enough.BTW - my review is not meant to be 'negative' - I am simply stating known issues that a potential buyer may not know. I just haven't repeated the positive or taken the speculative position of hoping to see the potential realized. My intent is very simple: provide a different view that isn't one of infatuation that simply repeats the specs on the Nokia site. Provide information that would have had me think twice before purchasing. I know what you might be thinking: would I repurchase it now? No. Not then and not now.End update]---------------------------I've had the N900 over a month so I'm familiar enough with the N900 now to write comfortably.I had high expectations and loved the N900 for the first 2-days. Every day since I've grown more disappointed. I should have sent it back for a refund w/in the first couple weeks (pre-ordered from Nokia). But, I was optimistic on the potential, which has withered as I've watched Nokia/Maemo do not-so-amazing things on [...]. The N900 is not complete - not even close. They've left out a lot of what we have grown to love and expect with other current smartphones (this really doesn't qualify as a tablet). Time on[...] has me very discouraged. They are very focused on Maemo 6 and it's obvious they consider Maemo 5 primarily in maintenance mode.I am still amazed that they released the N900 as is. Bugs, I expect, but I didn't expect it to be missing some very basic features that are now standard. I also didn't expect them to turn actual bugs into low priority enhancements or completely dismiss them as \"WONTFIX\".---------------------------------------Some quotes from Maemo/Nokia on [...]:If the reporter expects the feature to be officially supported then it is a WONTFIX [common comment]I think I can resolve this as WONTFIX entirely, since the feature can be perfectly covered by the community. [This is to create a function to disable/enable wifi]Isn't \"Settings -> About\" a more user-friendly way to look up the same? [This is about the lack of support of using USSD codes - simply weird]---------------------------------------One review mentioned it's built with steel, aluminum, rubber and plastic. Wish I could find more than plastic. It is very 'plasticky', feels fat, heavy and it looks cheap - nothing like the picture. It looks & feels like a digital camera you might have purchased 5-years ago. How did DROID get essentially the same internals into such a thin form factor and Nokia managed to make it look 10-years old?There are many positives about the N900 (and it does have strong *potential*). Many were written about. I won't re-write them. However, I will note many 'gotchas' that you would not expect from a 'flagship' phone from any manufacturer. The aggregate of the gotchas add up to borderline unusable (in my opinion). I'm not going to list everything, but will put down what would have me think twice about buying. I should have waited for an update or two. I can't say it looks promising though.Below are known issues. One is not confirmed by Maemo/Nokia, but the majority are WONTFIX or being left to the \"community\" (i.e. not Maemo/Nokia) - with a couple pushed for *consideration* for Maemo 6 (Harmattan). Bluetooth they \"think\" may be fixed in a future update. USSD codes they seem to be looking at (but haven't seen a confirmation of fix).I have noticed Nokia leaves it for the community to implement many basic features. Why would they bother with basic features for one of the most expensive phones out there? Even if you want an open platform and are familiar with Maemo, you wouldn't (least I don't) expect them to push so much to be done by the community. Android doesn't take things that far - sure, it's 'mostly' open, but they package the basics with the Android builds.- OS: It appears Fremantle (Maemo 5 that comes on the N900) is essentially in maintenance mode already. I've spent weeks on[...] and watched as they apply \"WONTFIX\" to many basic features that were reported as missing, marked true bugs as enhancements and low priority (e.g. doesn't allow you to use USSD codes - *#...#), sent enhancement requests to their \"brainstorming\" site, and many requests they accept are assigned to *possible* Harmattan (Maemo 6) inclusion.What does this mean? It's possibly outdated already.- LINUX: Better know Linux. Due to the lack of settings and missing granularity in those that exist, you'll need to know Linux to make many changes/check certain settings. If you do, it's just a pain to make changes via the terminal rather than using a GUI.- SETTINGS: There are very few settings. The settings that exist have very little granularity. No easy wifi on/off, only two profiles (general and silent) with very little available to configure. Click 3-4 times just to change the display brightness. No way to set a 'home' desktop that you and I are used to -nor is there a way to get to a particular desktop easily besides using both hands and swiping. Plenty more.- BLUETOOTH: Nearly unusable. There are two major, known issues: 1) it uses the same antennae as WiFi so if you have wifi on (takes 7-steps to disable it fully), bluetooth headsets are unusable: too much static heard on both ends, A2DP music has static and pauses, file transfers run around 20kbps and disconnect often. 2) Constantly disconnects. Live in a state/country where you must use hands-free while driving? Don't like holding the phone to your ear for long calls? Want to type while on the phone? Want mobility while you talk? You can't. It disconnects anywhere from instantly to several minutes. Upon disconnection, the sound doesn't transfer to the handset. It normally takes a power cycle to get things reoriented.- WIFI: Looking for an easy way to disable wifi when not using it? Sorry, we're not talking 1-2 steps for Android or 3 for iPhone, it takes 7-steps to disable (you have to assume it's disabled - no way to tell if the radio is off and maemo/Nokia haven't said for sure) and re-enable. Reported as a bug on [...] - they consider it an enhancement, pushed it off to Harmanttle as possible inclusion and said they'll let the community write something for Maemo 5 (nothing in the pipeline as of this writing). Hope you don't need to disable/enable wifi often.- BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD: Sorry. Several other smartphones support, but the N900 doesn't. I have an N810 and many of us expected the N900 to take its place as a tablet, but with a phone. Nokia/Maemo's official response? Not supported it and it won't be. They've marked several submitted bugs on this as WONTFIX. There is a way to get a BT keyboard to pair (if you know Linux), but don't bother, it doesn't support typical PC-105 layout and only some letters will work.- LANDSCAPE: I didn't think landscape would be that bad. It supports portrait in phone (if you can get it to move to portrait), but that's it. It is a BIG pain, especially if you want to use the device with one hand. Just entering a 5-digit PIN to unlock with one hand is very difficult. It might be livable, but the implementation is very poor.- MAIL FOR EXCHANGE (MfE): Far too many bugs to mention here. Barely usable - supports HTML now, but a few steps backward everywhere else. I'll hit a few: Doesn't properly map fields (both contacts and calendar), doesn't synchronize updates properly, doesn't seem to properly support the EAS protocol in general, won't properly synch with Google's EAS implementation (they said this isn't supported), etc.- MAPS: Can't use maps without a network connection. If you download map files - still no go. Also, Ovi Maps 1.0 takes ~10-minutes (sometimes longer) to locate your position. GPS is on, but Maps shows it's not active much of the time. I've found no way to route to an address; only two options: point to it on a map or type in a city/state/country in a search dialog - can't search for an address. Very slow.  Pretty much useless unless you want to know you are sitting on the right couch. No clue what Nokia was thinking with this.- GPS/CAMERA: If you want proper geo-tagging, you'll need to buy another device. GPS on, but photo is not tagged. It will tag sometimes if you have network positioning on.- BASICS: Are you looking for standard/basic functionality that your other phones you've had over the last few years have? The N900 is missing a lot. Far too many to list, but in addition to what's already been mentioned a few are: word suggestion is poor with no auto-correct (even a standalone \"i\" is not capitalized and it doesn't work in some areas), can't use USSD codes, no unconditional call forwarding, can't select different ring tone for contacts, can't mark contacts to automatically go to VM, can't change amount of ring time before going to VM, etc.- EMAIL CLIENT: Tinymail-based (not bad). Very poor implementation and the email client is very limited. Can't highlight text and copy, doesn't synch any folder but inbox and sent (you can view other IMAP folders, but if you delete an item - it's gone for good - no synch and no trash on N900, drafts stay on phone, etc.). Maemo/Nokia are on record saying this will never happen because \"it's too complex\" (common saying[...]), but look for it in Harmattan - maybe. Doesn't auto-fill/suggest as you type a name in TO/CC/BCC. No choice to return to inbox after deleting a message - you can only view the next message.- EMAIL CLIENT: Have to confirm each and every delete. There is no option to remove confirmation. If you deal with a high volume of email, it's a big irritant. It's been submitted as an enhancement request with Nokia's current response as \"It would be interesting to how popular such request is\" :-/ Weird that such basic functionality in every email client (mobile or not) that I can think of isn't on the N900 or its roadmap.Very poor email client - worst I've seen on a mobile device in years.This doesn't include all issues, but the review is long enough. Hopefully it helps with a bit of a different perspective by someone who has gotten over the infatuation and spent a lot of time working with Nokia/Maemo.</td><td>List(60, 80)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9046016772652105, 0.09539832273478953))</td><td>2.0</td><td>This was purchased to replace a broken case, and it didn't work.

Pairing with my Samsung phone was quite effortless: navigated to the proper place in the Bluetooth menu on the phone, turned the headset on, the phone recognized it and paired it with one click. Sound at both ends is very respectable, and no one has complained so far. The range is not very good at all though, so plan on keeping the cell phone by your side (or withing 10 feet or so) while you're using it. The earpiece loop has a positive feel to it so I always know it is there, but it is not annoying (yet). Voice dialing is simple and can even be done with mild background noise. A simple click of the button lets me answer a call or begin voice dialing a number from my contact list, or by number.I would like to have had a case to store it in, but for [...] I can buy something at the Dollar store to suffice and still be ahead of the game, plus it's small enough that I can just put it in my pocket. Surprisingly, the battery was practically at full strength when it arrived, so I was able to use it immediately out of the box. I haven't had to recharge it yet, but I've only been using it for less than a week. I would also like to have more voice commands, such as \"connected to phone\", \"out of range\", \"battery full\", etc., like my previous headset had (which I returned because my phone would not receive calls with it; turned out to be a bad phone), but the prompts for voice dialing are adequate.I may buy a more expensive headset in the future if I decide I want more features or a sleeker look, but there really is no need to.

Between them, I've also purchased and returned the Plantronics Voyager 510 and PRO due to how functional the Motorola's H7XX series as been for me.  I've always enjoyed the fact that all I have to do to pair a phone is open it up and enter the code on my phone.  When I want to turn it off, I simply close it. When I want to store it, it nicely fits in either the small or normal jean pockets (I never really got that from Plantronics and a reason for always coming back to the H7XX series.One thing I will note though is that all my headsets have gone bad within that 1 year warranty (not sure if its because I use it like hell or what).  Motorola's warranty has been excellent and they have always stood by their warranty every single time.About 9 months into my H715 the mic stopped working.  Others could not hear anything regardless of which phone I paired up with.  I called Motorola and explained the situation, we did some further troubleshooting and then they put together an RMA for me.  One draw back was that they are no longer manufacturing the H715's (bummer).  So they were going to replace it with a H720 (no way).  I explained to Motorola that I purposely purchased the H715 due to its ability to pair with (2) phones which I use extremely everyday (iPhone and Bold 9700) but the H720 does not have that feature.  She talked things over with her manager and they suggested that they could send me a H17 (I've never tried any other Motorola bluetooth headsets other then the H7XX series so I was somewhat hesitant).  They explained to me that it also had a boom mic similar to the H7XX series and the option of placing it in the ear (one reason Plantronics never really worked out for me) or placing outside the ear with an ear loop similar to the H7XX series.  They also explained that the H17 could pair with (2) phones.  So, I agreed.  When I received the phone, I thought they had sent me like an iPhone.  The packaging has changed from a regular headset box to what I would call... simply... Art (when you get the retail packaging you'll know what I'm mean).So, the in ear thing didn't work for me, I guess its just me, but the over the ear loop worked for me exactly like the H7XX series.  The H17 has really cool voice prompts when you open the boom, \"You are paired with Phone 1, battery is high, you are paired with Phone 2\".  The H17's volume is LOUD (coming from the H7XX series it is LOUD).  I actually have to lower it now.  The H17 is extremely small and even more compact then the H7XX series.  One cool thing it does is that it allows you to call from either Phone 1, by pressing the call button or call from phone 2 by pressing the call button and the volume button.  Non of the H7XX series headset had this nice feature.  I would normally have to hold the call button to redial from the previous phone but if I had to call from phone 2, I would have to start the call from the phone itself (great feature).I will continue to update this review if anything comes up.  I hope this H17 last way beyond the 1 year warranty if not, I know first hand that Motorola stands by its warranty.  One final note, the representative did tell me that the H730 would be coming out soon and is designed after the new H720 but with more features one being the ability to connect to (2) phones.  Depending on how things go with the H17, I might convert to the H1X series.***UPDATE 02/07/2011***I still stand by the review for this product and I can't fault it for the following update and thus I cannot take a STAR away from it.  This updated is geared towards professionals or those whom use their bluetooth excessively on one sitting.  As mentioned above, I have personally have used the  H7XX series and battery life is great with up to 12 hours of talk time.  I did not notice this \"feature\" on the H7XX until I was \"moved\" over to the H17.  As stated previously, the H17 is smaller and thus will have less talk time.  But I need talk time to be in the 6-8 hour range which the H7XX gave me but the H17 cannot.  Come to think of it, I will remove a STAR for one reason.  On the H7XX series, once I was hitting the battery \"limit\", the headset would worn me with various tones but whomever I was working with could still hear me crystal clear.  In the same scenario, the H17's voice quality is degraded significantly without any type of warning while wearing the headset.  People with whom I'm working with continuously say I'm cutting out around the time the H17 hits its battery \"limit\".  No type of warning, very annoying!!!Finally, I've gone out and purchased the H730 (w00t) and hopefully Motorola kept it the \"same\"...</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9499618682390697, 0.0500381317609303))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I really liked the Motorola H17 Bluetooth headset; the bluetooth charge lasts a long time and it  charges up very quickly too.

The plastic that the ear hooks are made out of are very cheap.  You will have to be very genital when you take your bluetooth off of your ear or the ear hook will break.  I don't quite understand why they don't make the ear hooks in a hard plastic like the BlueAnt bluetooth ear hook.  Too bad I can't use the ear hook for the BlueAnt because I would definitely change it out and use it on my Motorola H17 bluetooth.  Right now I can't even use my Motorola because of the ear hooks.  I tried ordering the ear hooks from a different company but returned them because the ear hook only lasted 1 week.

Good news is it's so cheap that I may not even bother with the whole returns process because I'd much rather not have to frustrate myself to drive to the local UPS store to mail something for five dollars in returns.  So buyer beware, do not buy through amazon prime. Their return policy requires you to actually return it rather than them shipping out a new one or returning the money.  I will recommend that you buy it from a 3rd party vendor that has a tendency to send out a new one or refund it.  I don't even understand as what will Amazon's warehouse even do with a device that doesn't even work.Now as to why it's so bad or atleast the one that I received is that even next to any fm receiving device I'll get 80% static in noise.  Now curiously enough if I place my hand or any body part on the device the signal will clear up and work perfectly fine as if I was some kind of huge antennae.  Once I lose contact however the signal degrades again (I actually have the same issue with a very old fm radio that doesn't have an antennae hooked up and if I touched any part of it the signal would become crystal clear).  Now I actually did get it to work ONCE but then when I put my iPhone down it would just cause static again.  Now at first I assumed it was my phone's cell signal causing an interference (it never hurts to be careful) so I turned it on airplane mode and tried it again, no luck. Also even with the whole touching the device &#34;solution&#34; didn't perfectly always work.  Out of the whole broadcasting range I was able to find only a couple stations that actually worked (slight exaggeration).  Also of those my device had to be set to one broadcasting frequency higher than what my car or other fm radios were set to which is quite peculiar as if I set it to the actual frequency it would stop working altogether.The remote that came with the device also did not work.  I assumed the batteries were dead and having some of those circular ones lying around I tried replacing it and it still did not work.  But that probably wasn't even the case in the first place since it did come with a plastic insertion that separated the device from the battery when packaged.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.3820874573499664, 0.6179125426500335))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Sold my iPhone 3g I was so satisfied with the Droid.

The touch interface is will done.- Full exchange email support including calendar, contact sync, and email folders.  Separate corporate calendar is cool too.- Voice search is the bomb. I searched \"McDonalds\", \"home depot\", and \"gas station\" and found the closest ones to my location.  I searched on \"Phone John Smith Mobile\" and droid made the phone call.  I even searched \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" and got the wiki page. lol-  The free GPS is excellent.  The satellite layer is awesome.  I was going to buy a GPS so the Droid saved me a couple bucks.- Facebook contact integration is nice.- Tethering is available via the PDANet app.- Battery life is surprisingly decent.  I returned many good windows mobile phones simply because of the lack luster battery life.DISLIKES- No Send or End Buttons.  I'd much prefer initiating and terminating a call with dedicated buttons- Flat keyboard causes some typos. The top row of keys are too close to the bottom of the screen.- I don't like the window shade motion for notifications.  I'd prefer a simple button press.- When viewing emails in landscape mode, the on-screen Delete button is right next to the back button.  I deleted 2 emails already. :-P- I've observed some button press glitches when switching between landscape and portrait mode.- No pitch and zoom in the browser.  Browser seems a bit slower than with the iPhone and the Palm Pre.- Many operations require a couple extra button presses compared to my old Blackberry.- Right now, I'd only recommend the Droid to people with a bit of geek in them.VS IPHONEThe Droid is a worthy alternative but it doesn't sniff the iPhone's total user experience.  Syncing media with your iPhone is much easier.  The iPhones web browser is still the best on any phone.  The Droid's customization capability, voice search, awesome free gps, and comparable development platform does put it on the same playing field with the iphone.  The Droid however still has to make the UI a little more polished and take steps to make syncing with your computer more seamless.  Right now, I'd only recommend the Droid for people that have a slightly higher geek meter.VS BLACKBERRYCha... I never asked my Blackberry to do much more than send messages and make calls.  And to date, it still does it better than any other device I have ever used.  The sleep case, keyboard, trackball, and typing short cuts makes the BB the most efficient device you will use for messaging.  The Droid (and the iPhone) will require extra button presses to complete the same tasks.  Heck, the sleep case alone allows you to check a message without pressing a button. ;-)BOTTOM LINEThis is a great Verizon smart phone, possibly the best.  The voice search works brilliantly.  It's unbelievably good.  The GPS is great.  The Droid development platform seems decent.  I especially like the Droid's full exchange support.  The Droid's battery seems decent but I'll find out for sure after a couple weeks at work.  It's certainly not as bad as the launch Palm Pre-  the Pre's battery life would count down in front of your eyes. :-POne major gripe I have with the device is the lack of Send and End buttons.  I would never ship a phone that doesn't have Send and End buttons.  I prefer to locate these buttons by feel rather than locating them on the touch screen.Another gripe is that many functions on the Droid requires several extra button presses to accomplish the same task versus my old BlackBerry.  I just have to wonder if phone manufacturers ever have business people test their phone. (I'm available, Motorola! ;-)Should you try the Droid? Absolutely!  BlackBerry users should hang on to their receipts however.  You will give up some efficiencies in exchange for the Droid's advanced features.</td><td>List(298, 307)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7723219826869104, 0.22767801731308956))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I mistakenly bought this thinking it was made by Motorola for Droids in general.

I then bought the Plantronics Voyager Pro and have to say that for stability, it is rock solid- it stays on my ear very well, stays in place, and the sound is like no other bluetooth I have had - even when driving, it has loud, good, clear sound and people that I ask say they hear me very clearly and loudly.  The microphone is quite a bit longer than the other bluetooth headsets out there and it actually looks like a microphone - some people may think this is a bit old fashioned but I love it - it brings the mic closer to my mouth so when I speak, I sound MUCH better - This one is a KEEPER.</td><td>List(12, 13)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9815654828115646, 0.01843451718843534))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I bought two of these headsets at the same time for use with my blackberry.

The clip on clamshell fits the phone perfectly, leaving all the ports and buttons available, though I suspect this would not be compatable with any of the docking accessories (I don't have any). It will come off the phone fairly easily but I wouldn't want to do this every day (and I suspect the locking tabs would wear or break too quickly). The only small comlplaint I have is that one of the locking tabs on the display part of the protector will press a couple of the keys as I open or close the display.  I hope this will improve over time, but its not a big problem for me even if it continues.The holster has a nice tight belt clip that holds the phone close to my body so that it is not sticking out to snag on things. The phone fits into the holster with the display inside so that everything except the ports on the phone are covered and protected. The display cannot accidently slide open while in the holster. So, on my belt I feel the phone is well protected against normal dings and the headphone port and volume control are easily accesible if I want to listen to music or talk on a headset.I had the BodyGlove OEM case and returned it because it did not provide nearly the protection I wanted from a carrying case.

I can hear my callers just fine and they can hear me loud and clear.  It is pretty comfy to wear but at time, if it is not placed right, it can make the back outside of my ear ache a little.....right where my eyeglasses rest and curve around the top back of the ear.  It may require some tweaking of my glasses to finx this so i am not sure if it is a design flaw of the headset or my frames.  Hmmmm.This headset did malfunction after just 2 month of use which seems to be unusual for this product and i noticed the seller does not accept returns for headsets so I called the manufacturer, VXI - got their number off their website  blueparrott.comThey were very helpful and got me to tech support who promptly gave me instructions to send it in for repair (or replacement if they cannot fix it).  This was very easy.Normally, I would not give 5 stars to a product that malfunction this fast but from what I read, this is atypical of the product and the company stands by their products and make it easy to have things taken care of.

However, the cards appear to work the same so the rest of my review should be relevant.As others have noted you will need a few add-ons to make the card truly useful the most important being a US (or your your country of choice) based number for voice and SMS. You will also need to add funds to your account which must be done in $25 min increments from the companies web site. There are several discount packages available for voice, SMS and data which can reduce the cost of these services. It's nice they can be purchased separately depending on your needs but costs start to add up quickly. Sorting through the options can be confusing as the website, while complete, can be difficult to navigate. They company rolled out a new data package in the middle of my trip which came as an unwelcome surprise as the previous package was not grandfathered. Documentation that arrived with the card was pretty good although somewhat generic.Set-up was a little tricky; make sure to test in advance. If you are comfortable fiddling with settings I recommend against auto programming on Apple products as it permanently installed an APN profile which can not be easily removed (understatement) even after returning to your original SIM. This may be anomaly of the Verizon variant of the iPhone 5. I had the most success immediately resetting my network settings when switching SIM cards. Note this will also erase all of your stored WiFi passwords. On two occasions I had to fully restore my phone from backup as data failed to work after installing my original SIM. Possibly a Verizon only problem as some network settings are hidden with the Verizon SIM installed; there may have been some leftovers from the OneSimCard configuration.Customer service is a bright spot. I had the opportunity to interface via chat, traditional support ticket and voice from the US and France. In each case the response was excellent with knowledgeable, helpful personnel. I sensed the company did not have extensive experience with the latest apple products distributed through Verizon but they worked hard to address issues quickly. Calls to customer support are free.PROS: Excellent voice quality calling to the US from France, Italy and the UK all on the same SIM. Nice! The company also offers a VOiP option when connected via WiFi which drops the rate to 1-2 cents per min. Perfect for extended conversations from the hotel and other areas with a good WiFi signal. I found the VoIP app needed to be in the foreground to work reliably. Data worked in all countries once properly configured which can be a pain. Make sure unnecessary background services, especially iCloud, are disabled while roaming as rates are still expensive even with discounts. Detail usage reports can be viewed on the web in near real time.CONS: SMS was flaky and did not integrate well into iMessage; I could only effectively communicate with colleagues using apple devices. While incoming SMS messages are free they are exceptionally awkward to send so most folks didn't bother. Some test messages never arrived further discouraging use. iMessage refused to send outgoing SMS messages to folks I had previously communicated with as it appeared to strip the country code prefix from phone numbers even when manually entered and/or updated in contacts. Frequent SMS users should look elsewhere especially if using apple products.SUMMARY: A good card for voice centric users who will be traveling to multiple countries.</td><td>List(1, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9999996430867638, 3.5691323619523916E-7))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Here is how it worked for me (or actually for my wife who went to a conference in France and then to Amsterdam). I had an old off-the-contract iPhone 3GS that I had AT&T; unlock for me. Installed the SIM card (regular for 3GS - not the micro version), activated the OneSim account on-line and got a USA phone number assigned to it (turned out to be a Texas area code) and the SimCard already had an international (Estonian) phone number printed on it - so all seemed good, until over the course of the next 10 days, while she was away, I discovered the following:Receiving calls1. The US phone number is NOT FREE. It's free to a caller from the US (if they have free US long distance like most people do) but the OneSim account is being charged $0.20 per minute while it is accepting a call placed to that US phone number.2. The international number that the card comes with is the Estonia country code. One of the most expensive out there, except maybe countries in Africa. So the OneSim card will not be charged for a call to that Estonian phone number, but the caller from the US will pay at their regular international call rate. I tried using my Google Voice (turned out to be $0.33 per minute - for comparison a Google Voice call to Israel or Russia is about $0.02 per minute). Also using MagicJack, calling from home, was about the same price per minute as Google Voice - and calls to Israel and Russia are also next to free from MagicJack.So it seems like the solution would be to call the US phone number assigned to it and pay $0.20 per minute off the OneSim card account, right? Not so, really... I paid $40 for it and it came with only $10 credit which pretty much all got used up while I was testing the SIM card (calling/answering and texting to/from) after the installation while still in the US. Oh, yes, sure you can recharge the SIM card account but it starts with the $25 minimum!Placing calls:Calling from France and Netherlands to the US was about $0.30 - 0.50 per minute! If the account balance drops below the per minute price, you can't place calls or receive calls to the US phone number assigned to the card (as would be expected) BUT also you CANNOT receive calls to the Estonian phone number either (which is supposed to be free and not require any money from the SIM card account). So no communication, then. The person calling you better check your account balance to see if you have money there to receive a call that is supposed to be \"free\" for you. And you can add $25 minimum. That seemed like a scam to get you to pay at least $25 more to continue to use the \"free\" features that come with it! My wife ended up having to send me emails using wifi to recharge her account until I figured out to check the balance regularly. I ended up recharging the card account for $50 in the end just so that she would not be without a phone while I am asleep here (time difference).Texting:YOU CANNOT TEXT TO THE US NUMBER ASSIGNED!!! I called the customer service, they picked up pretty quickly, but the girl at first pretended like she was not sure what problem I was asking about (like no one ever asked about that before) and then sounded pretty annoyed that I was even asking why my texts to the OneSimCard's US phone number get returned with an error message. She explained that it says so in at least three(!) places on the website - \"so of course you can't text to the US phone number - it's a landline!\" I asked if I will have to pay my regular international text message fee (AT&T;) to text the Estonian phone number - she said something like \"Duh..., obviously\". AT&T; I think takes like 50c to a dollar for one of those international texts. However if you have two iPhones and the international one is connected to WiFi at the hotel or at the conference or wherever, then the \"Blue\" iMessage will work and will be free to both sides. But you never know. If it turns green after a few minutes, you will have to pay for a text message. So I waited for my wife to text me that she is at the hotel before texting her back.She was able to text from WiFi only. I opted out of the OneSim data package when I activated the account. It seemed too expensive to begin with.Technical weird stuff:When you call a US phone number from that OneSim card phone you are not actually calling that number. You are letting their computer know what number you want to call. You dial the number and press \"Call\"/\"Send\" and the phone immediately hangs up with \"Call Failed\" screen. A second or two later, it's ringing as if that person were calling you back. You pick up and hear the dial tones - that's when the phone of the person you were calling begins to ring. Not a major inconvenience, just seems like not the most elegant way to do it and feels like ancient technology like that should cost next to nothing, but it does not!!! (see the pricing above).Conclusion:It was better than nothing (worked for voice calls most of the time - unless the balance was low), but turned out to be much more expensive than I expected. I ended up paying a lot of $$$ on top of the original purchase price and will not be using this card again. I will try to do more research and find a better alternative.I could not believe how many 5-star reviews are out there for this product so I clicked on some \"See all my reviews\" buttons next to the glowing 5-star reviews. Seemed like the ones I saw came from people who wrote only one review total. Just for this \"awesome\" SIM card and their unparallelled customer service and never any other product reviews. And most of the ones I saw were not \"Amazon Verified purchase\". Maybe whomever wrote them will read this and catch on to that and add a couple more reviews for other products to make it look more legit. In any case, this is hardly a 5-star product. Not zero stars (it kind of works for voice calls and you don't pay more than you would have paid if you just brought your regular iPhone abroad), but it's 2-stars at best.UPDATE: The next day after posting this review, I got an email from OneSimCard demanding to edit the last part of it and remove the sentence that was there saying that I thought that maybe their marketing guys wrote those 5-star reviews under various aliases. I was happy to remove the sentence to make them happy - everything is clear regardless. I also used that opportunity to change the rating to from 2 stars to 1 star.</td><td>List(38, 42)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9833116608727066, 0.016688339127293485))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I wasn't even going to give the T505 a try, but, after reading pages and pages and pages of good reviews here on Amazon (650+ people have reviewed it, and it still has 4 whole stars), I thought I should give it a chance. If it didn't work out, I could just return it and only lose a few dollars on shipping. I'M SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT! And it's definitely not going back!I previously tried the Jabra Freeway and the Motorola Roadster bluetooth speakerphones. Neither of those devices met my standards for having clear, handsfree conversation and streaming music and audiobooks through FM with very little static the way the T505 does. The T505 is fantastic and works so much better than those two speakerphones put together! Handsfree conversation is much clearer and crisper, voices aren't muffled. Callers have told me road noise isn't too intrusive or unpleasant either. I drive a 2008 VW Rabbit, and road noise isn't very loud in my opinion. FM streaming is clear, and hardly any static is present when the T505 directs me to a station. The T505 seems to take over whichever frequency it chooses to stream through, even the ones on which I can normally hear faint voices and/or music playing! You can also choose to have the T505 remember presets for you if you prefer a particular frequency, and the guide tells you how to set that up. It's pretty easy, but, even if I use a different frequency each time, I don't have a problem hearing my streaming media without interference here in Knoxville, TN.The volume range on this speakerphone (the unit itself, not through my car's speakers) is very good, and I usually don't have to adjust it when I get a phone call. Another thing I like about this device is the fact that the function tones are short, pleasant and not annoying to hear, and the automated British-accented female voice is pleasant as well. I mention these things because on the other devices I tried - the Jabra Freeway's automated voice was too loud and not adjustable, and I could never find a comfortable setting for the regular volume during a call. I also didn't particularly like having the words \"call ended\" blurted in my face every time I hung up my phone. The Motorola Roadster had a generic startup sound that I didn't care for, and the shutoff tone was a little piercing and annoying. It did have a decent volume range, though, which could be adjusted quite high and low during a call, but callers' voices always sounded muffled anyway.One of the coolest things about the T505 is that somehow there is a little more bass pumped through my car speakers when I play music using the FM function. It's like I got better speakers without having to buy them! I don't know if that is due in part to the applications on my phone having better sound quality than regular radio, but, needless to say, music sounds great and better than expected. Also, the play/pause button works perfectly with the Pandora and Audible apps on my HTC Droid Incredible smartphone, and the volume up/down buttons become next/previous track buttons.My only very, very, very small gripe about this speakerphone is the lack of an auto on feature. It does have an auto off feature, which powers the T505 down after 30 minutes of no bluetooth connection. So when I walk far enough out of BT connectivity range - about 30 to 50 feet, I don't have to worry that the speakerphone will stay on for hours on end and lose its juice. Auto off is good enough for now, but if Motorola could start making new T505s with an auto on feature, too, it would then be pretty near perfect.Can't comment on battery life yet as it hasn't run down all the way. I've only had it for a week. I will update that info on here once I reach the first charging session. I don't mind that it only came with a car charger, because wall chargers are cheap on Amazon if I need one for in the house.The T505 is a wonderful speakerphone, and I highly recommend it to all looking for a handsfree solution for clear conversation and a more enjoyable driving experience. I am almost tempted to buy another one as a backup for the future in case the one I have now ever breaks. I hope Motorola doesn't stop making it, because, whenever I need to replace this unit, I'm coming back for another.</td><td>List(2, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9958491588188645, 0.004150841181135575))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've been looking for a way to get my HTC Touch more \"integrated\" with my factory sat nav system in my Yukon. I already had the BlueAnt Supertooth II bluetooth speaker phone, but really wanted something that would work with the stereo.So I pre-ordered the ROKR T505 and have been using it for about a week now. First, in the box, you don't get a whole lot. Just the unit, visor clip, a DC charger, and very detailed and easy to understand instructions. However, since it uses mini-USB, any one of my many AC, DC, or USB chargers will work just fine. This device is also quite compact when compared to the blueant device and looks good sitting on the visor (also unlike the blue ant).After it was charged, I easily paired it up to my Touch, and media player (which was already open) immediately start playing music. I made a few test calls in the house, and it works great. The internal speaker is nice and loud (on par with the BlueAnt), controls are well placed for car use, lights and tones are easily understood, and the music will automatically pause/resume when you receive or place a call.After reviewing the rest of the instructions to understand what the buttons did (recommended), I took it out to the Yukon, and pressed the \"FM\" button. The unit talks to you telling you which station to set it to. Once you tune the requested station, you now have full stereo sound through your car stereo for both Voice and Music. If it has a bad signal, simply press the FM button again, and it will find the next free channel.I made a few test calls while parked and while driving around and it works just as it did in the house, except in stereo sound. While people could hear me OK, they could easily tell I was on a speaker phone. This is partly due to the vehicle being louder than usual on the highway (aftermarket exhaust). Voice recognition (voice tags) on the Touch also worked through the T505, just as it does with a bluetooth headset.Through the stereo, I could hear the caller just fine. But in my area, which is in a big city, I did keep getting intermittent static, regardless of which station I was on. While not a major issue, it is rather annoying. Changing the station does help, but as you drive, it tends to pickup other stations in the form of breif static and may interfere with your phone call, requiring you to find another free station.As noted earlier, incomming calls will mute your music, and it tells you the phone number that is calling. It won't say the name of the person on caller ID however. Even though I didn't really buy this to play music via FM, it works about as well as your average FM transmitter. So when a call comes in, I just press a button for the pre-programmed FM station that I previously saved in memory, then go back to CD when it's done. Although if you prefer to use FM for Music and Voice with your phone, this will makes things a lot easier for you. Just keep in mind that this is still FM, so don't expect anything near CD sound quality.Overall, everything does work as advertised. The battery has lasted on a single charge all week, but haven't had a chance to see how long it will go. Unfortunately, the FM issues are annoying, but expected. Your results will of course vary depending on the sensitivity of your receiver and number of stations in your area. So to wrap things up, here is a list of pros and cons.Pros:* Excellent compact design with well placed controls* Bluetooth supports A2DP (Stereo Bluetooth protocol)* Very easy to use* Voice dictation of certain commands* Speakerphone nice and loud* Mic picks up voice over moderate background noiseCons:* Expensive* FM transmitter could be better* No AUX outputBasically, once you understand what it will do and determine that it meets your requirements, this is definately something to consider. However, I personally plan on waiting for something that uses your AUX audio port instead of FM. Not to mention something that is a bit cheaper ($139 US at time of review).

This Nexus One hasn't failed me yet; it has strong 3G connectivity with T-Mobile and strong Edge connectivity with AT&T.;  The phone is gorgeous (AMOLED display - Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode) and amazingly fast (snapdragon processor) and fun (Android 2.1 interface enhancements)!I love the droid platform that you can customize and aren't stuck with the rigid iPhone experience.I love Google's turn by turn navigation which usually works for me by voice command such as \"Navigate to Fry's Electronics\" and it will give me choice on screen of which two locations in my city do I want directions to?  I touch screen my selection and it starts telling me how to drive there.  I have found Google's Navigation better than Garmin in that it gives a better gas-saving route and tells you the turns before you get to them rather than after you already passed them.  I do prefer hard keyboards which Nexus One doesn't have so Verizon's Motorola Droid wins out there!  I was hoping they had used the money saved on no landscape keyboard to put in BETTER microphones and really fix the Voice Command making typing obsolete, but no.  However, Swype and other keyboard apps can improve your virtual keyboard experience.  The phone has been dissected and the parts apparently come to $174 in change and the rest is Google's profit.Another reviewer said low battery on Nexus One, to fix that, just download free app Advanced Task Killer and shut down running software that you don't need running and it will last longer.  Also, you can make it run edge instead of 3G which will save on battery.  There are a lot of settings you can easily adjust to conserve your battery life.  Battery life for the Nexus One is as follows: 10 hours of 2G talk time or 7 hours of 3G talk time; 12 days of 2G standby time or 10.4 hours of 3G standby time; 5 hours of Internet use on 3G or 6.5 hours on Wi-Fi; 7 hours of video playback and 20 hours of audio playback. According to FCC radiation tests, the Nexus One has a digital SAR of 0.867 watt per kilogram.Also, another reviewer said that low privacy due to syncing with his desktop, but you can turn off syncing in your settings if you don't want them to sync.  The syncing is actually one of the features that I think appeals to most Android/google fans.I love the Amazon ap and being able to scan UPC codes to do comparison shopping and read Amazon reviews!The 3D AMOLED screen is breath-taking. The interactive wallpapers are fun.I bought the Nexus One unlocked from Google for $529 plus tax.  I have always been impressed with how innovative google is but the experience of buying a phone from them is horrid.  I would not do it again.  They are not providing any customer service other than to tell you to call TMobile about the service or HTC about hardware questions.  Google will not provide a customer service telephone number even AFTER you have given them almost $600; there is no customer service on the packing slip or anywhere to be found.  They have a help forum where supposedly you can get help from other CUSTOMERS but they themselves will not help you out.  TMobile CSRs say they will have this phone available for sale in their store by the end of January and I would definitely recommend buying it from them instead of Google. Also if you buy it from Google, TMobile insurance against damage, loss, theft, etc is unavailable; the only insurance you can get on the Google phone when you buy from google is from square trade which has a deductible and is limited in what it will cover.  I do really like and use the UNLOCKED status of the phone and don't know if TMobile will be selling it unlocked as that is something new to be offered in USA.  It is so great for traveling abroad; just pop in a prepaid SIM card from that country and you are ready to roll without roaming fees!  I suppose if TMobile doesn't sell it unlocked you just need to go to the same little bit of extra trouble to unlock the phone so you don't end up having to turn over the farm to TMobile/AT&T; for roaming fees!I received my phone 01/08/10 and am thinking it is a definite keeper but I am still playing around with it and learning it.  Nexus One is FUN!  It is pretty!  It is fast!  It is so enjoyable I have almost forgotten the awful Google buying experience.UPDATE jan 17 2010 - I brought my Nexus One to the AT&T; Kiosk and the guys there both said WOW, I was happy with my iPhone 3GS when I woke up this morning but now I want one of these!  I explained it was only on EDGE and not 3G but they said that the snapdragon processor made up for it that you notice the speed lag only in downstreaming video or megafiles.  they volunteered that AT&T; is \"in no hurry\" to get the Nexus One running on their 3G network since they can not sell the phone and all the retail profit is going to google; they are putting their efforts into their next new phone which I think they called the Elite.Google now has a couple of employees on their help forum attempting customer service but failing.  Google has made its fortune by advertising mostly and acting like any actual interaction with their customers will give them the cooties, so I guess it is too late to change.  Offering the phone unlocked when brand new is really great and may be lost if only sold by the carrier.  So Google if you are listening here is how you can go into the phone-selling business without getting the cooties - partner with Amazon and Wal-mart (retail and online).  These retail giants have proven records of consistent great customer service.  Let them sell your unlocked phones for you and collect a profit for providing customer service and you get to continue to rake in the big bucks without having any actual contact with your customers and not tarnish your reputation when people experience what it is like to interact with you rather than admire you from afar.  The retail store with the best customer service record in cellphones though is Best Buy; let them sell your phone unlocked and customer satisfaction will soar!Another reviewer said he didn't know why people would buy it here for more than what google charges but the answer is crystal clear - one google is not selling to many countries yet and secondly amazon will provide customer service and won't charge a re-stocking fee.I am really enjoying my Nexus One and am thinking it is the KEEPERFeb3, 2010 updateThis phone really shows off YouTube!  Their HD concerts and other clips are stellar to watch on this phone!  Watching theater previews on the movies app (free) is a fun experience.  The picture is HD and the sound quality is best with ear phones.While there are fewer apps than iPhone, there are more free apps.  How many apps does one need anyway?  I try to keep my phone light so it is ripped and ready to fly fast!There is a great silicone coating making the nexus one almost impossible to scratch!  There is a great YouTube video where someone is intentionally trying to scratch the nexus one screen as well as the back with their car keys and can't!  : )I got a computer in my pocket and I am lovin' it!UPDATE Feb9,2010 Now there is a Google Nexus one Customer Support number 888-48Nexus (888 486 3987) so might be worth a try to purchase from Google!  Maybe they have seen the light!Also software update released earlier this week includes MULTI-TOUCH that so many people seem to really like!UPDATE Feb16,2010 Google Voice is fully integrated on this phone so using it for texting in or out is as easy as the regular messaging icon.  But Google Voice has free text messaging so you can have your carrier block texting using their system and save the $10-20/month or whatever your carrier is currently charging you for texting.UPDATE April24,2010 I purchased the car dock and am loving my N1 even more!  You can use your phone with a Bluetooth headset while it's in the Car Dock; when you dock your phone for the first time, you'll be prompted with a dialog box to select the dock's audio settings. Just uncheck the \"As speaker phone\" option, and your phone will be able to pair with a Bluetooth headset. To change these settings later, go to Menu > Dock settings while Car Dock is running.UPDATE May31,2010 I guess the Nexus One is no longer available on google's website and will soon be sold in stores where you can pick up, touch, and play with before shelling out big bucks.  I am still very happy with my Nexus One!  If I was to choose again today the smartphone right for me, I would choose this one again.  My son just terminated iPhone Friday and got theHTC DROID INCREDIBLE Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)from Verizon and that is probably the best choice for him as he wanted to leave AT&T; and go with Verizon.  The incredible is made by HTC like the Nexus One that I enjoy!  I love the open android platform and think he will fall in love with it too.  He has only had it a few hours but already is saying how cool it is to be so integrated with google unlike his iPhone.  I prefer my NexusOne as I can stick an activated GoPhone SIM card in there and it works; I don't have to sign a 2 year contract for overpriced service like my son did!  He had to pay AT&T; money too to get out of his iPhone contract.  I'm on wifi most of the time and just pay for AT&T; service when I need it and I am free to do something else if I ever decide to do so!I found this review comparing cameras between htc nexusone and htc incredible:  The Nexus One takes better pictures than the Droid Incredible.  How is that possible?! you say? The Incredible is 8MP, thats a whole THREE MORE MEGAPIXELS you say. Well, I think it boils down to the megapixel myth: the common belief that more megapixels equals a better camera, which isn't always the case. There are a wealth of other factors in play here, the lens, the flash, the CMOS sensor- all of which can contribute to better overall image quality.Also Engadget compared cameras on Incredible and N1: With all this talk of the Droid Incredible ousting  the Nexus One from Verizon Wireless, having a better multitouch implementation, and just being newer and shinier, you might think this comparison of cameras is just mercilessly piling on the pain for the original Googlephone. After all, the Nexus One and its 5 megapixel sensor came out a good few months ahead of the 8 megapixel Droid Incredible, so surely this battle would be over before it's even begun? Not so fast, says Android and Me, whose diligent testers have put the two HTC handsets through a side-by-side shootout. As it turns out, the Nexus One  rather swept the contest in both naturally and flash-lit shots, while the Incredible habitually exhibited a blue hue in less than perfectly lit photos. Both cameras were adept at taking excellent daylight photos, as is to be expected, but the devil is as usual in the details -- and you can find all of them at the source link below.YouTube has many short videos comparing nexus one to incredible or droid just type in nexus one vs incredible or type in nexus one vs droid or whatever phone you want to compare to.  Basically NexusOne and Incredible are very similar.  N1 one is a little bigger.  Incredible has more plastic.  incredible has track pad while N1 has trackball; both light up.  Incredible has HTC sense which gives you built in widgets; N1 uses google android widgets but you can download all the other widgets to N1 so the difference is really only that the incredible comes pre-loaded with the widgets through HTC Sense.  N1 has less storage. Incredible has an enhanced micro usb.  one might think since the Incredible camera has more megapixils that it takes better photos than N1 but that doesn't seem to be what reviewers comparing photos taken side by side are saying!  The Incredible gives you 7 homescreens with leap feature whereas N1 has only 5 homepages but really I am not using all 5 of my pages yet and plan on never doing so as how many apps does one need really?  I like to keep my smartphone trim and fast!  N1 has longer battery life than Incredible which may really be significant as short battery life is one of the major complaints for N1 and Incredible's is shorter; some say it is the HTC Sense that eats up the battery life so maybe incredible users will be uninstalling it, if THEY CAN!The other night we were out eating crab buckets at a very loud rowdy restaurant and we decided to go shopping afterwards but didn't know how to get to the mall from here so I pulled out my N1 and really didn't think it would work with all that noise, but i spoke navigate to xxx and it got it 100% perfect!  My friend's jaw dropped and said How did your phone do that?  My phone won't do that!  (she has a G1).  If you get the N1, you'll be hearing that a lot \"How'd your phone do that?  mine won't do that....\"To other reviewer Shunundo - i agree with you that speaker quality is tinky and really need to use with earbuds or bluetooth.  If you have trouble seeing in sunlight, adjust the settings and see if that helps.  the phone has automatic brightness, it has a light sensor built in, when you are in bright light, the brightness lowers, and raises when in the dark. You can disable this and customize the brightness level by going to Settings>Sound and Display>Brightness.  AMOLED screens are not the best choice if you are a lifeguard in the sun all day but prettiest for normal lighting day and night.  Also did you know you can turn your N1 camera flash into a flashlight without rooting it?  there are SEVERAL android apps for that.  I agree with you that wifi is the best way to go and I am on that almost all the time for speeds as fast as my desktop!UPDATE - On the wireless settings, there is an option for \"Tethering & Portable Hotspot\". Once you turn on \"Portable Wi-fi Hotspot\" you can tether any wireless device. Saw someone at the park on July 4th with the iPad, and 2 iPod Touches tethered to N1 ~ this completely blew all of us away as the 3G connection was lightning fast for all 3 gadgets! N1 wasn't rooted.UPDATE 7/20 My phone updated to Froyo 2.2 seems like weeks ago and my son's incredible hasn't updated yet; he is still on 2.1 and really wanting 2.2.  I've heard Nexus One owners are always going to get preferential treatment from Google over their other android customers.UPDATE 10/10/10 - I am still lovin' my Nexus One!  It just keeps getting better and better and I have not had a single thought about switching to anything else!UPDATE 8/18/11 - I AM STILL LOVING THIS PHONE  I was getting some error messages about insufficient HD and decided to upgrade my microSD card instead of deleting photos.  It came with a 4GB class 4 MicroSD card but is upgradable to 32GB.  I purchased a PNY 16GB class 10 card from Amazon for about $20 and now my phone is almost instantaneous on everything.  I can not imagine ever going with anything other than android when it comes to a phone.  No one can beat google navigation!  I did decide on a HP touchpad when it comes to a tablet but I am also VERY interested in the new android Hollywood tablet with a QUAD processor coming out by Amazon preset with amazon shopping.!!!  I just love that this phone just zips through everything!!!  Amazon's android app store can not be beat either.</td><td>List(186, 198)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.4849697890008517, 0.5150302109991484))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Came in a timely manor and in the retail box.

I read those bad reviews as well as the good ones and came to one conclusion: As long as this device works, its sound quality and noise canceling is excellent. With this in mind, I'd rather pay a higher price to avoid the BULK packaging items. I even checked out from Costco Warehouse since they have the best return policy as well as the convenience.Highly recommanded.

I returned the first one because, at that time, I was testing a Zumo 550 which has Bluetooth capability, but the 550 uses older Bluetooth protocols (prior to A2DP) so it only had low-grade mono Bluetooth.  This was fine for linking in your cell phone or getting spoken instructions, but it was lousy for music reproduction.  The sound quality stunk on ice, but I then held that the 550 was to blame.  As a result, I put the 550 up for sale and returned this BT receiver until I could obtain a Zumo 660 which uses A2DP protocol.I knew when I got the 660 this would be my first choice for testing the quality of Bluetooth reception, and I was not disappointed.  I plugged in a set of good quality headphones (as earbuds tend to sound \"tinny\"), and the MP3 playback from the Zumo 660 was as clear as if I was listening off my normal MP3 player.The only \"con\" I note with the Sony Ericsson is that when paired with a Garmin Zumo 660 the \"play/pause\", \"skip forward\" and \"skip back\" buttons on do not interact with the Garmin Zumo 660.  As I understand Bluetooth, this is a pairing issue that can vary from device to device.  I know the Sony works as designed because this shortcoming did not happen when it was paired with my iPhone.  This IS NOT a deal-breaker for me as I intend to manipulate the player via the controls on the GPS and not on the Sony as the receiver will always be tucked inside my jacket where I can't reach it while riding.  I can't say for certain what the full range of the receiver is, but I left the Zumo 660 at one end of the house and walked to the other end with no degradation in sound quality.  So, that's at least 50 feet or so...more than I'll ever need.So, if you have a Garmin Zumo 660 or 665 and don't mind that the controls on the device WILL NOT interface back to the GPS but want a quality BT receiver for listening to tunes, GPS and phone, this is a great deal.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9898958290610408, 0.010104170938959168))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've owned two now. The first stopped powering on after a few weeks,  but I loved it so much that I returned the first and ordered a second unit. A quick search of the internet will show that many users have experienced the same power issues, so I knew I may have this issue the second time around. So far so good however! What I love about this device:Battery lifeTruly epic.  I listen to either bluetooth or the on board fm tuner all day (when starting from a full charge)  without so much as a worry. It just keeps going and going and going......... You get the picture!FM TunerThis is invaluable to those of us with limited data plans who can't afford to be streaming all day long. Although I am not one of those few (my data plan is unlimited), I still listen to the fm tuner when I feel the need for a change. Like many other cell phone or mobile devices,  your headphone is the antenna so you cannot really blame reception issues on the MW600. That said,  reception is very reliable and strong and in my metro (Orlando)  I can usually listen to the radio all day along without issue.Feature setI can do something on this device that I cannot do on many other bluetooth devices. I can split profiles. On my work phone (a bonafide dumbphone)  ii usually connect the phone profile,  and on my personal phone,  a tmo gsii,  I connect the media profile. I hadn't been able to do this prior with any other bluetooth device, so this was a pleasant surprise.  This split profile management can be controlled directly from the MW600 because of the lcd screen, and indeed it operates flawlessly.LCD ScreenHighly useful and very visible even in daylight. It features a simple black background with white text & icons, so contrast is no issue. The iconography is very clear from identifying which particular phone you're connecting to,  to volume level display etc. Its much better than the audio cues that most other devices rely on.Audio qualityI immediately replaced the supplied buds with a Samsung set. There was no low frequency reproduction,  mids were ok and the highs were somewhat lacking. The Samsungs were much better in all these areas.  Even so,  the beauty of the MW600 is that you can plug in whatever high quality headset that suits you best because it features a 3.5mm headset on top which allows that. So kudos to Sony for including that.OverallTheres a reason I bought two,  and its because its worth it. If my second unit craps out and Amazon takes it back I dont see a reason not to buy a third.  There's probably nothing that tops it in features on the market at this point in time.  Sony should work on the long term  quality though,  then this would indeed be a 5 star product. Til then 4 stars very well describes the quality and worth of this product.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6129518538848274, 0.3870481461151727))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Did absolutely nothing to give me better service.

I tried this out using the including mini magnet mount antenna. I got the amazon bundle, which included the wrong antenna, it had a female end that was the same as the sleek device. No questions asked on the return total refund and refund on the shipping too. Thats why I shop a lot on Amazon. I have very few incorrect orders. A+ on the service.  Now the device.  I downloaded a few apps that showed signal strength so I could measure the boost of the signal.  I live on the fringe of 2 antennas, N. Illinois, US cellular.  US Cellular is by far the best for coverage in the northern 3rd of Illinois and all of Iowa. I don't know how it is elsewhere.  The results were o.k. a 1 bar gain, again keep in mind it is the very small mini antenna that was included I expect more when the correct(larger) antenna arrives. The numbers I got were 15 to 25% increase.  It seemed to be more variable meaning it would go up and down a lot and not stay on a consistent level as it does when not using the booster.  I would say if you are in a weak signal area...meaning you do get some signal then you will benefit from this. If you are in a complete dead zone without an antenna within 10 miles then you are not going to get any with this. It boosts whats already there. just wanted to mention that because I read some bad reviews  that pertained to that.  I expect a 50% boost with the other antenna, if I get that I will change to a 5 star.  One other issue is that it uses the bigger micro usb for a plug in, I havent had that type for years. Last few years all of mine use the mini USB. I dont know the ratio of the 2 types of chargers but Id prefer the other type. It just adds another charger to the collection. Well built, I believe I read  made in USA. Always a plus.  The wrong antenna had no number on it to know it was the wrong one until I opened it. Seemed odd there wasnt a model number on it, no wonder the wrong ones are being sent out, There were other reviews of people getting the wrong one. I was extra careful ordering and still got it wrong.</td><td>List(1, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8938780338288534, 0.10612196617114651))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I purchased this 4 port USB charger for use with my cell phone, iPad 2, Kindle, and iPod Shuffle. The charger is small and doesn't take up a lot of wall space, and has a blue indicator light, indicating power flow. The charger does work charging up to 4 devices, HOWEVER, it only does so on a limited flow of power, and doesn't even charge my iPad 2. The amount of electricity used is similar to that of a non-powered USB port on your computer. For example, the USB ports on a standard Apple USB keyboard do not power devices; this charger uses the same kind of ports. Even plugging in one device at a time does not charge at full capacity. When I plug in my iPad 2 via its dock connector cable, my iPad displays \"Not Charging\" next to the battery indicator; worthless! When I plug in my Samsung Nexus S 4G via its USB charge cable, it takes twice the usual time to charge to full capacity. I did not notice any significant difference in charging my Kindle or iPod Shuffle than with their factory chargers.Overall, this USB charger is an awesome idea, but it fails to live to its expectations.

Eventually we came down to two choices, the Seidio Innocase Active Case for HTC EVO 4G - Limited Edition because it look impressive and the reviews were great, and this case because it was cheap and looked like it was well built. Both came in around the same time and we compared them side by side, and to be honest this case is WAY better than the Seidio one. Even at more than half the price this AMZER case trumps the Seidio in flexibility, quality of build, overall feel, button accessibility, looks, well.. everything! Now my friend is returning his Seidio so he can get this case! When we first got the cases, the AMZER came in a plain looking package, while his came in some fancy shmancy packaging. I was beginning to think I had made a mistake, but once we had taken them out of the packaging it was pretty clear who had the winner.It isn't that the Seidio is a bad case, its just the protection just isn't the same. We tried drop tests on both of them and his sounded like a loud \"CRACK\" which made me cringe every time we dropped it from about 12 inches, while this one made a soft thud and obviously absorbed the blow much. much better. The buttons with the Seidio were difficult and uncomfortable to push, while the AMZER was smart and made the case a little bit softer where the buttons are which made for pressing them just as easy as if there was no case at all. The Siedio has a much less flexible material compared to the AMZER and is not comfortable in the hand at all, the AMZER feels like it is conforming to the curves of your hand every time you hold it and actually makes it much easier to hold thanks to the anti-slip grip that the Siedio does not have. Overall the AMZER trumps the Seidio in almost everything. The Seidio, however, is a winner when it comes to repelling dust. The AMZER does pick up a light amount of dirt/dust that is not very hard to remove but still can be an eyesore if not maintained. The Seidio seems to not pick up any dust.If I were to pick between the two, I would save my money and go with the AMZER for sure.</td><td>List(4, 4)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6587165788303532, 0.34128342116964683))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Delivery and quality are fine.

It's a no brainer! Kensington at \"no-name\" pricing, dual power slots at \"single slot\" pricing, 10 watts at 5 watt pricing. It's sold direct by Amazon, not by a 3rd party vendor closing out on over-stock.Did I mention it came with an original style cable, which seems sturdier than the Apple which is prone to fraying at the juncture with the connectors themselves?So I dutifully come back here on December 24, 2012,  to review it, and suddenly it is $24.96! Not a buck or two more expensive, almost THREE TIMES as expensive.Now at $9.99, that's a cheap price for a name-brand cable, let alone for a dual slot power supply, with one of them delivering the full 10 watts preferred by the old iPad 3. But at $24.96 the decision is much tougher - go with this one, or with a no-name for half the price? Do I really need an extra cable (at this higher price), or would a no-name without a cable be ok? What about a no-name that is reviewed as being able to deliver 10 watts but only if the other slot is unused? What about a no-name that can only deliver 5 watts, enough for my phone but not for an iPad? See, I got the first class, feature-rich charger, WITH cable, for a stripped, generic device price. Yay! But - why the pricing difference? Is it still worth it?See, products don't have \"absolute\" value. They have value relative to their price.The new model of online pricing - varying prices daily, or even hourly - is making it really hard to shop.This isn't limited to Amazon, the NY Times did an article this holiday season about how Target, Best Buy, and WalMart, among others, varied prices day by day this holiday season, post-Black Friday, to match or beat their competition, and which store had the most consistently low prices - which wasn't consistent across all products. I just read an article that another retailer, Staples, even delivers different online pricing depending on your zip code and nearness to one of their identified competitors, like Office Depot.So this review is a little different from my other product reviews, and different from the other product reviews of this particular product.For the best insights on performance of this product, read the two top-rated reviews here - I believe those two are honest, objective, and insightful. The only thing I would add, is that I have three Apple cables that are frayed at the junction with the actual connector - the flex portion wasn't well-designed. From the looks of it, the flex portion on the Kensington cable is longer and thicker - which should extend the cable life at this critical juncture where more stresses occur. The first top rated reviewer has actually used this for over two years and reports that, yes, the Kensington included cable does last longer, so that is a nice bonus. Secondly, and don't laugh, now that Apple has released the new Lightning Connector, I like the fact that Kensington departed from \"Apple white\" to make their connector in black - why? - because it's a lot quicker to grab the right device cable when black means old style and white means Lightning. Yes, this comes up, since I have devices with both styles of connectors and travel with both. It's just one less thing to be annoyed by, when trying to charge them.In terms of pricing strategies, good grief, stay on your toes! Amazon USUALLY has very competitive prices, if not the best, but now more than ever it pays to comparison shop, even to open an \"Incognito\" browser tabe in Chrome to see if searching cookie-free returns different pricing. Above all, comparison shop, and if you don't like the prices today, bide your time, and post buying, monitor the prices for the first month so you can ask for a price adjustment if things get out of whack.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8853395734578408, 0.1146604265421591))</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is my first case for my iPhone 4 (my first iPhone, as well).I wanted a case that didn't take away from the sleek look of the iPhone 4, and preened diligently through Amazon.com.  At first, I wanted a temporary cheap-o case 'cause I planned on purchasing the Otterbox Impact when it finally released.  I don't remember exactly how I stumbled upon this one, but after being discouraged by the plethora of knock-offs on eBay, I wanted a decent-looking one with somewhat of a return policy, so I ordered this one.It's a great case, and the material doesn't have much of that \"rubbery\" feel that I've encountered on other silicone-type cases.  The only other case I own for an Apple portable gadget is the iSkin for my iPod Video, and, though it's a fantastic case, the material makes it so it's a hassle to get it out of my pocket.  Not so with this case.It has a slight stick to it, but not where I have to slide my whole hand in my pocket to remove my iPhone.  The argyle pattern is very nice, and only adds to the design.  To be honest, I think it makes my iPhone 4 look even better.In terms of protection, I don't really expect this to hold up against nasty drops.  I haven't dropped my phone yet, but the case is pretty thin and I'm afraid it won't hold.  Only time will tell.The only other issue I have is that the nibs for the volume and hold buttons get a little indented, but it's really not that big a deal.  The case covers all but the dock port, speaker/microphone, headphone jack, silent button, and rear camera and flash.I'm still considering ordering the Otterbox, but this case makes the aesthetic that much more wonderful that I'm reconsidering making this my primary case.  I've already gotten compliments on it, and may have inspired some others to make this one of their iPhone 4 case purchases.</td><td>List(15, 15)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.854429109145986, 0.14557089085401395))</td><td>3.0</td><td>This case is very pretty and sturdy.

So, after more than 10 years of overpaying for shoddy service, I quit and decided to get some pay as you go phones while we decide which phones/ plans are right for us. My daughter is in college and uses her cell as her primary phone, hence needing it more than the rest of us.  For her I got a touch screen on virgin mobile (that cost $150).  I went with them for the lower cost comprehensive plans.  My son barely ever used his phone, so I got him one of these thinking the $50 credit would last him a year. *NOTE* The included $50 is only good for 2 months....so this turned out to be a bit more expensive than I had thought.  BUT, the phone itself is pretty great....I bought an LG 610 for myself (net10) thinking it would get me the service I needed at a very low cost.  the phone is decent, but does not have many features, *and* I will note that the plan is almost the same as at&t;'s.My son's phone (this model) is so so much better, and at a lower cost, that I bought another for my husband....and now, I have phone envy.If I could return my $40 phone, I would, and would trade it in for one of these.  Not only does it have a large bright touch screen, but it has features found on many of the higher end models: a camera, a calendar and date book, mp3 player, note taking feature.I have looked at just about every pre-paid phone on the market and this beats just about all of them at a fraction of the price.  In fact, now that I see that you can get a bigger card which holds the minutes longer (and at a lower cost/ month) I may side-line my phone and buy another one of these for myself!I will add, for those of you who have one, or are thinking of purchasing one, that it does not come with a case.

Only 4 mm thicker than Otterbox Commuter, which has a hard plastic shell and seems likely to crack. This will not crack and will survive a fall well.  This is not just a silicone case.  It is reinforced where it needs to be and everything is accessible, even on VERIZON iphone 4.  Proximity sensor appears to work fine.There are 2 drawbacks:1.  It collects lint/dust.  But its easy to wipe off.  The benefit is that it is non-skid so it may not slide out of your pocket or across the table.  This is a plus for the most part.2.  The fit - The case is very snug on the top and bottom.  It could be just a bit tighter on the sides but it is not a problem.  You can pinch the sides of the phone and the silicone will move about 1mm.  Not a big deal.Overall, there is NOT a better case out there for the money that offers drop protection and a screen cover.  It looks good and is not more bulky than most other cases.  This is definitely a winner and I will be returning the Otterbox Commuter, which was uncomfortable and seemed likely to break.</td><td>List(4, 4)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(5.559934774815515E-4, 0.9994440065225185))</td><td>5.0</td><td>The Good:* Great call quality* Solid overall messaging* Android OS* Android Market and tons of free apps* Rich multimedia experience* Free navigation softwareThe Bad:* Exchange support from stock app is lacking even with FroyoBottom Line:  The Droid X is great multifaceted smartphone that will become an integral part of your daily life.My detailed usage based review follows.Call Quality:  Let's face it.  It doesn't matter how cool all of the other features are if a phone doesn't perform well on the original intent of cell phones.  The Droid X, however, happens to excel in this area.  I had a Motorola flip phone about five years ago, and I loved the call quality it provided.  It doesn't matter if it is a regular call, speakerphone, or on Bluetooth, the Droid X has outstanding voice clarity and volume on both ends of the call.Form Factor:  One of my biggest worries with the Droid X was how big it is.  To satisfy my concerns, I went to a Verizon store and asked if I could see what one would feel like in a case attached to my belt.  It is by far the biggest phone I've had lengthwise, but I haven't found it to be a problem.  It also feels good in your hand much the same way that the Harmony One Remote does (see my review).  Don't fear the bulk of the Droid X because what you get in return is well worth it.Bluetooth:  Speaking of Bluetooth, I started out by pairing the Droid X with myJabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headset(see my review).  While I had read inconsistent information on this topic, my experience is that voice commands worked over Bluetooth.  The Bluetooth radio (even if not connected to a device) does put an extra drain on the battery of the Droid X.  I keep it turned off unless I am planning to use a Bluetooth device.Messaging:  The Droid X has support for a myriad of messaging capabilities including text, G-Mail, and Corporate Exchange Servers.  While Android provides a Universal Inbox, I prefer to view messages separately by type.  Fortunately Android lets you access your message the way that you want to.  I have to admit that I was hesitant to go with the Droid X for messaging because I have had an LG V, EnV, and a BlackBerry Curve 8330 (see my reviews) so I was very attached to a phone with a physical keyboard.  However, I have been very pleased with the virtual keyboards on the Droid X.  I enabled Swype entry which allows you to trace the letters of the word you want to type and automatically adds spaces between words.  I played with this feature in a Verizon store before purchasing, and I would recommend anyone who is hesitant to do likewise.  With my text entry concerns addressed the Droid X is a highly capable messaging phone.  One final note, though, is that the Exchange support is pretty sketchy with the stock client after I upgraded to Froyo.  I will be purchasing either RoadSync from DataViz or Touchdown.  I have trial versions of both installed.  Each works well at a basic level, but there is a cost difference.Android:  I'm combining a few attributes here.  The Droid X comes with 7 home screens preconfigured, but users have almost limitless customizing capabilities on how the screens are laid out.  I use very few \"widgets\" (Motorola or Android) because most of these maintain data connections or otherwise drain the battery.  As such I lean toward application shortcuts instead, and I get my information on demand.  The great thing is that you can tailor your user experience to suit your needs and concerns.Also, coming from a BlackBerry I was absolutely thrilled with Android Market.  There is no comparison between Android Market and BlackBerry App World.  Whether its performance or selection of apps, Android Market wins in a landslide.  Also as one would expect, Google provides apps that are only available for Android such as Sky Map which is very cool.  There are also apps aplenty for news, sports, weather, social media, and the list goes on and on.Multimedia:  This is the first phone that I've given serious consideration to multimedia on.  The stock music app is OK, but there are many alternatives available for free from Android Market.  I am currently using MixZing which produces good sound, good features, and a decent user interface.  Android market also has apps for Pandora, Slacker Radio, and Last.fm to name a few.  I don't think the sound on mp3's is as good as it is on myCreative Zen X-Fi MP3 Player.  The X-Fi processing produces a quality of sound that is hard to beat.  However, I will be switching my mobile video watching (mostly from Amazon Video On Demand) from my Zen X-Fi to my Droid X because the screen is much larger.  I can also watch HD videos too.  I can't do the quality of the display justice in words.  You've just got to see it.  When connected via Wi-fi, I love watching YouTube videos with the \"HQ\" option turned on.  The multimedia experience on the Droid X is really, really good.It is also great on the capturing side.  The 8 Mp camera takes sharp pictures, and I was surprised at the quality of video capture.  I have used theFosmon HDMI to Micro HDMI Cable (5 Feet)(see my review) to view both on my Magnavox TV, and the results are unbelievable.Navigation:  I am also shocked at how much better Google Maps performs on the Droid X vs. my Curve.  I'm sure some of it has to do with the increased horsepower on the Droid X.  The navigation app is also pretty well done for something that is included with the device.  It is not as full featured as a Garmin, but it should satisfy most basic navigation needs.  It does give spoken turn by turn directions, and I found the routes to be pretty reasonable.  It's hard to argue with having one less device to carry and not having to pay anything additional to do it.Games:  I'm not the biggest gamer in the world, but there are plenty of free games in the Android Market that appeal to me too.  I have word and number games along with various card and domino games.Overall:  The Droid X is a must have device.  It does so many things well without messing up the basic phone functionality.  I'm very pleased with having made the switch from my BlackBerry, and I have not looked back.  Highly recommended.</td><td>List(5, 5)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8768278039773718, 0.12317219602262824))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I bought this Nokia Phone because I had aonther one but this one must have been defective, the battery does not pop out, so even with tools could not work that out.

The problems with it are as follows.  The entire side of the unit is your answer and hang up button.  If it starts to slip out of your ear and you push it back in,  you hang up on your call.  I got my wife one also and she hung up on someone three times, it is difficult to avoid.  The volume control is unique others had an issue with it hanging up their calls and I can see that happing since you have to gently glide your finger up and down the side to control the volume,  a little too much pressure and goodbye.  To charge the unit or turn it off you must return it to the stone holder, the USB charge is on that device only, if you forget the base at home you cannot charge it while on the road or turn it off.  The other problem I have with it taking it out of the stone base is supposed to turn it on and activate it, I had to place it back in the base and remove it three times to get it to turn on.  This has not been an uncommon problem for me, I called tech support and they told me to exchange it.  I would like to see Jabra take  the over all design and lose the stone piece place a usb connector and a real on off switch with a more pronounced answer key.  Not sure how they would design it but the comfort of this headset is better than any I have tried.  I also purchased the Jabra Extreme to try and that is a very good headset, I can write more about it later but the extreme like other headsets begins to hurt your ear after you have been wearing it for an extended time.

So I am replacing my old battery (i currently have two, a new one and one that came with a Samsung charger stand I purchased) that originally came with my phone.Like another reviewer stated, I received a EB575152VU instead of a EB575152VA.  It was packaged in a plastic bag, and it had a newer date on the battery (May 2011). The battery looked like a real samsung battery, just the wrong model number. The battery's white water damage indicator was showing xxxxx across the top indicating that the battery was damaged due to water.  However i figured that it was re-manufactured so I tried out the battery and it does work on my captivate, however the battery will not charge through the phone!  the phone will shutoff if you even try to charge it.  Since i can't charge it, ended up returning the battery.My order was through Alpha INC. who has recently changed their names to Emerald LLC.  It was fulfilled through Amazon so please do NOT buy from Alpha or Emerald!  Amazon of course was helpful in getting a refund.  Their advice for finding a real samsung battery was to try out another seller... lol.  I ended up just getting this off ebay, but these batteries are only $30 from Samsung's official store.Conclusion: Be careful who you order from, and make sure it is NOT Alpha INC. or Emerald LLC.

I had trouble getting the two pieces clipped together properly all the way around the phone.

Also harder for my fat fingers to use the touch screen new the edges of the glass.Finally, the clip part of the belt holster is so big that you can't just slide and pop the phone in. You have to physically lift the clip up before inserting the phone all the way and releasing the clip to hold the phone in.Poor design, not one of Siedio's better products.

We placed the order twice and the first time, no USB cable was included (other folks seem to have had the same issue) and the second time the cable included was a generic cheap USB cable, not the one originally supplied by Kensington. No wonder a dock that is usually available for $30 or so in stores is available for half the price here.I hate to rate this product a 1-star because I feel it doesn't accurately reflect Kensington's product quality, but rather our purchasing experience as a result of dishonest sellers.I find it surprising that it was so difficult to find a reliable dock that was original and brand new.

There is no problem reaching the controls or charging the phone with the case on. The back is sturdier and appears to be more durable than other cases I have tried. The first thing I really liked about it was how the case feels when I hold the phone. It is smooth but not slippery. I noticed on the packaging that it has a \"soft touch, double coated anti-slip finish\" and that describes it perfectly.The instructions were easy to follow to add information that makes one \"findable\" if an honest person finds the phone and wants to return it. There is space for much more information to be shared, but I just wanted the basic information to guide someone back to me in case I lose my phone. I can see that a business person or someone who wants to be more sociable would find the case even more usable for sharing much more information than I do. Still, it is an inexpensive kind of \"insurance\" for me if the phone is lost and someone does want to return it to me.For my use, I can find nothing wrong with the case or missing that I would add.

I tried two Bluetooth headsets before and returned them because I could always find some unbearable problems with them.  This is my third try, and it's perfect.  Sound quality, control design and layout, and the comfortableness, are all very likable and hard to pick on.  Unless this thing breaks down unexpectedly in the next month, it's a keeper.The body could be smaller, but there is a good reason why it is hard to make these smaller.  It's not the electronics that makes this bulky, but almost entirely the battery, which, as a technology, has unfortunately fallen behind the electronics, and as a result every electronic device is suffering.Some users complain about this not being \"plug-and-play\".  If by \"plug-and-play\" these users mean one should be able to put the headset on an ear and start to hear from a device (phone or PC, etc.) right away without any pairing procedure, let me tell you it is a wrong expectation (not just unrealistic, but wrong).  This is not a technical problem, but a human problem.  It is actually not difficult to make a Bluetooth headset that could connect to a nearby device automatically and instantly, but the problem is that you would end up with an unusable product, because you Bluetooth headset would automatically connect with any device that is nearby, causing both security issues and confusion.  The little bit of inconvenience in requiring a certain procedure of \"pairing\" is necessary.  It is not because the engineers are unable to make Bluetooth devices that can talk to each other more easily, but because of security concerns. It is a universal problem for wireless technology. Every wireless device has this inherent problem.  (That's by the way also why Wi-Fi has been such a headache for many people to set up.)  In order for a wireless device to work properly, you've got to have, by design, some kind of a barrier for the user to overcome, such that the barrier would work as an inherent proof of legitimacy.So don't complain. Just happy pairing. And this headset has already made it as simple as the current technology allows.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9314415771891509, 0.0685584228108491))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I love the looks of this case.

It's fairly easy to open, etc. Good for using an extended battery but you won't really have and real protection of the extended battery if you drop it. I mean sure, it's covered by the black thin rubber outer housing but that's about it.The little locking tabs. These tabs can and will break easily especially if you open and close the inner case to many times (take the phone in and out)The Proximity sensor - Yes, I have confirmed that due to the design, it does interfere with the proximity sensor. I've tested this by not having the face plate on, making a call and putting the phone close to head to where I can still see the screen go black.I then tested it again by making a call and just barley moving the front cover over\\near the phone and the sensor activates and shuts off the screen until you remove the faceplate.The other issue I have with this is, the front top area of the face plate. In the pictures, where the camera, sensors and ear speaker are, it shows it to be more of a longish round area. The one I received is more like a rectangle type shape. Kind looks like a boat shape. So that alone might be why the sensor is not working correctly.Since this item was twenty dollars, rather than me trying to modify the case, I will be returning it.Over all, I think it's an OK case and I don't really think it's all that bad. Could serve it's purpose. I would not try putting it through a drop test. Even upon calling the seller before I purchased it, they told me that they didn't even drop test the item before selling it.I did test the front and rear camera and flash and nothing on the case interferes with the camera's.I am returning the item as the seller has agreed to take the item back and refund me the purchase price including the shipping costs to and from. I will update later on that process.So, in all all, I'm not going to bash the seller on this item as for some people may really like and it may work for them. It just does not work for me. I would have given 5 starts if the face plate did not interfere with the proximity sensors and if the area on the front face plate matched that of the stock photo. Again the issue being, that in the stock photo, it's round\\ovalish. The one I received is more of a boat shape.The overall:Pros:1. It can give some basic phone protection2. The case does not interfere with the rear or front camera's or the flash.3. The belt holster seems pretty sturdy and strong. Does not seem like your phone while in the case will easily pop out\\off.4. Was not really difficult at all to remove the out housing at all if you simply follow the instructions.5. It does accommodate the use of an extended battery.6. The screen protector works just fine. Some have received it as it being \"Too Tight against the screen\". I did not find this being the issue. I did find that near the bottom it was a little airy like but no issues at all with using the touch screen itself.7. No problems with having one of those stick on screen protectors on the phone with use in conjunction with the faceplate screen protector. Both can used at the same time.8. The faceplate screen protector is very clear so it does bother the HD picture display on the phone.9. The seller was very quick to reply to my email, concerns and request for a return and refund.Cons:1. Front face plate does interfere with the proximity sensor.2. The locking tabs seem like and I am sure will break easily. Therefore not a good idea to constantly open a close\\take the phone in and out.3. No real padding\\protection of the extended battery except for the outer thin rubber housing of the case.4. You can not easily remove the screen protector as it is glued into the inside of the faceplate. You would have to cut of the screen protector from the faceplate if you did not want to use it.

The provided case protect decently from short falls ( around knee high), but I wouldn't intentionally put it to the test. The size the battery adds to the phone is noticeable, but it doesn't bother me cause I have had an ottorbox defender on my phone and it feels about the same size to me. When I first got the battery it was a nice secure fit into the phone, but as time has gone by the fit has gotten loose to the point the battery doesn't always make a complete connection and my phone shuts off. The customer service was more than happt to help me until I told them my battery can not be returned under amazon thirty days policy, that's when the run around started. I wss told to send the proof of purchase and reason for a replacement to one e-mail only to get back a response that they can't help and I needed to send the same info to a different address and I got the same response there.

Took a few shots of it alone, and with an HTC Droid DNA being charged.This external battery comes with a USB cord that has a micro-USB end (or you can just plug your device's USB cable into it), we tested it with much success as summarized below.  Packaging was simple - a form-fitting, zip-loc style plastic shipping bag with accessories wrapped in their own plastic bag. It was easy to open. Even though this battery pack has an amazing capacity - 6,200 mAh - it is still of convenient size and weighs at just 5.7 ounces.Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our wall adapter (used my son's Samsung S3's wall adapter) and let it charge until 100% full which took about 4 hours to complete. When charged, all of its blue lights are lit.Operating this unit is a breeze -- just connect your device to one of the ports with the USB cable. Its ease-of-use is a good thing and the operating manual that comes with it is easy to read if you find that you need it.The storage capacity of this battery is outstanding and the charging times we experienced were impressive. We tested it with a Samsung S3, HTC Droid DNA, and an iPhone 5C... and, on average, we the device's battery gained about 1% per minute (it took the Samsung S3 60 minutes to go from 23% to 83% charged) when using the 2.1A port (charging times using the 1A port were about twice that of the 2A port).  As is typical, the phones did get a little warm during the charging process but no warmer than if put on its own charger.  The battery pack did not seem to heat up at all.The Amazon sales page and the documentation note that there is a 36 month (3 year) \"Warranty Guarantee\". If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this battery gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.This type of portable power for this price? What's not to like? Affordable, portable, and did the job as described by the manufacturer.If you are looking a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then we recommend it highly.Go for it.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8523395682718193, 0.1476604317281806))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I got this package on time...

If you're trying to decide between these and the Anker batteries, those these ones.I bought spare galaxy s3 batteries after my parents yelled at me for not calling them after one of the football games. So I looked on this Amazon, and saw that both these batteries and the Anker ones had pretty much the same reviews, both about 4.5/5, and I think I saw more reviews on the Anker ones, so I bought those. That was the wrong choice. It's partially my fault, as I kept using the Anker battery charger, which would only charge the batteries to about 92-93% maximum. I always saw it as a problem, but I ignored it. I always felt like I had decent, not great battery life, so I just just kept doing it. But about a week ago, one of my spare batteries started emitting chemical smoke, so I trashed it (I got my phone in September, so I think I bought it in October, which means that it lasted about 7 months or so. The other is still working fine). I had already adjusted to having multiple back ups, so I bought these.These batteries are of seriously high quality. I didn't like them at first glance, just not the biggest fan of red batteries. These are about the same length as the Anker batteries, but they feel heavier (they do fit, have no fear even though you can tell it's a little more snug). It said on the packaging to charge each battery for about 12 hours before the first use, which kind of bugged me but whatever. The anker charger actually charges batteries (including the Anker and Samsung ones) to the full 100%. It's a rather noticeable difference. I haven't returned to the Anker or Samsung batteries since I got these ones. They last a long, long, LONG time compared to the old ones. I feel like I could honestly say twice as long at this point (note how the old charger couldn't max charge, I think that's a part of the problem. But you will use the charger on a daily basis so it matters a lot).Summary:-The battery life is absurd.-Charger actually max charges all batteries to 100%-The batteries are slightly heavier, and it's kind of noticeable, although not a problem-The charger is built to completely cover the back half of the battery, so it's a little hard sometimes to take the batteries out. This shouldn't deter you at all.-Once again, the battery life is awesome.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9587832261792641, 0.041216773820735825))</td><td>4.0</td><td>This battery appears to be the composite of three batteries in a vinyl plastic. It fits very tight into the phone and may present some challenge in installing or removing it.  The back-cover case is a soft rubber and is easily applied or removed. It fits comfortably in a front shirt pocket.I think this is a much better buy compared to getting an external power supply; for one it is less money. The battery life is amazing. I drove 500 miles with the gps on after a 3 1/2 phone call. Spend another two hours talking plus ran the hot spot and the LED light for about an hour before getting the power down to 1%. An entire weekend, three solid days, with 3 hours of gps, and providing hot spots for hours is very doable. I have been able to run gps for 30 minutes on 2% power left and still had 1% left . Night time resting uses about 3%.The manufacturers wants you to charge the battery up for 12 hours the first time it is used; this is challenging if you are a heavy users. Then they want you to run it down to 1% the first six times you use the battery.What is needed is a smart charger and/or a docking cradle.I got an update after having the battery for 3 or 4 months. It lost its potency suddenly. The directions say to run the battery down to 1% and continue charging it for an hour or so after it reaches 100% for the first six recharges. I did that and continued to do that afterwards. Plus I have always charged it in the phone and with a factory power supply until two nights ago. I charged it in the phone, but I used USB plug that came with a surge protector that I got from Sam's Club. When the battery reached 7% power, I got a warning to recharge now. So, I plug the phone back into the Samsung factor power supply. After 7 hours it had recharge up to 65% and that was unusual; however, within an hour it was at a 100%. At the end a light day of usage, it was at 50%. Normally it would be somewhere between 80 and 90%.I went to the return window with Amazon and it said the return policy has expired. I clicked on contact seller button and I got survey to fill out. If this battery no good, I would like to get the 9 amp model, but it is from the same company.</td><td>List(1, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5979243799293524, 0.40207562007064757))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Great case.

This is a solid case, and contrary to other's reviews is very solid and well built. Doesn't feel \"cheap\" at all. This is the number one reason I am keeping it and returning the Seidio. It passes water tests time and time again with no leaks (mind you, I've taken it apart and back together at least 10 times already.)Very nice, confidence-inspiring clips every time it goes back together. Not so with the Seidio OBEX.Sound quality is just fine (for calls), I can hear people just fine and they can hear me as well.Screen response is perfect. I have a screen protector installed on the phone itself, and the case works just fine with it- I'd even go as far as comparing the touch response to that of a naked iphone screen.Sound from the phone speaker is audible but very muffled, but what do you expect from a case like this? Tired of seeing this as a 'con' to people.The vibrate switch is reversed but works just as good as the actual phone's switch- this was another con for the Seidio OBEX, the plug they use is terrible.Bottom line- this case works great.

If you shatter the glass, it can be replaced (for a hefty fee), but short of cracking the whole phone in two (which doesn't happen even if a car runs over it!  My wife learned this from experience), water appears to be the kryptonite death from which there is no return.I really liked the idea of a Lifeproof case because it seems to have a full line of stuff associated with it: skins likePink Leopard \"Protective Decal Skin\" for LifeProof 5 Case(if pink leopard is your thing), aLifeproof 1333 Bike Mount for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Black, evenLifeproof 1335 Arm Band for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Black(though I have found that theSport Armband for Otterbox iPhone 5 Defender Series Case (fits many iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S / 4 Protective Cases)works just fine).  Basically, this accessory has accessories.[Update 25 APR 2013] I just discovered that through the lifeproof website, you can get Skinit cards to change the look of your case whenever you want.  This is AWESOME!  It's a bit clunky, however. [End update]The screen protector is also nice, since I don't have to actually glue rhino skin or anything else onto the front glass.  That sort of thing makes me incredibly nervous when applying, and it doesn't come off.  Since I plan to sell this someday, I want to have this in as close to factory original state as I can!  The screen protector makes everything a bit less responsive at the edges of the screen, which has so far only been an inconvenience when playing Angry Birds.The biggest problem: it feels CHEAP.  MyOtterBox Defenderprovides a textured soft rubber case that goes over the rigid shell.  It's huge, but feels like the phone is protected from just about anything.  This on the other hand, has a smooth plastic that feels like it's going to slip from my grasp, and not protect it from anything (that's perception only though: I've dropped it a few times already, and everything appears fine).  The fact that it takes up less room than the defender in my pocket is a plus.There's also an issue with getting things into the port.  My original apple power cord works, but myAmazonBasics USB A to Lightning Compatible Cable (3 Feet/0.9 Meter)doesn't fit through the case!  That's probably Amazon's fault for not meeting the specs to the millimeter, but if it happens for one 3rd party device, it could happen for others.I don't use the speakerphone, or even the headphone jack, since I have bluetooth everything.Given that I already have this, I'm not sure if I will stick with it or go back to the Otterbox.  On the other hand, if you're trying to decide whether to buy this or that, it's hard to justify the extra cost of the Lifeproof: just keep the phone away from water.  And I'd ditch them all if a rugged battery case ever came out!  Mophie's Juice Pack Pro is only available for the 4/4S form factor, not the new elongated one of the 5.[Update May 23rd, 2013] Some colleagues who bought the lifeproof case complain that the fascia that covers the power port has broken off.  They have not yet tried contacting Lifeproof to see if this is covered by their warranty.

So sadly, despite my love for the rest of the design, I could not use it.The fit is very tight and will not work with any side skin protector pieces. Removal is quite hard and scary. I had to use some force to pull it off and was worried I would break it, but it popped off with no problems in the end. The material is not actual metal, but still looks great in my opinion. It adds little bulk and feels good in the hand. I really wanted to pair this with my Spigen aluminum home button, in which they went together so well, so I was greatly disappointed I could not.I can't say anything about the screen protectors as I already had some installed and did not try them.If you have no need for extra wiggle room for your lightning port and do not plan to switch out your bumpers/cases often, I would highly recommend this bumper.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9310733033947551, 0.06892669660524485))</td><td>2.0</td><td>Held charge once, used once (only re-charged my iPhone up to 50%), now it won't hold a charge the battery  is dead minutes after a fresh charge.

Needless to say, my 2 children would need constant entertainment to keep them from asking &#34;Are we there yet?&#34; Their new tablets (Christmas gifts) came in handy. However, when it came to the time to recharge them I noticed that my existing car adapter didn't work. At that time I thought all the car chargers are the same. After I returned home I even called Samsung and reported the issue. The tech suggested me to send in the tablet for them to take a look (something I didn't need to do!). I only reported the problem on one of them, thinking that my kids could still have another tablet to play at home. It took a total of 8 days (sent it on Mon and got the tablet back the following Wed) for them to &#34;fix&#34; it. When I got the tablet back the first thing I did was to plug it into the same car charger. The problem still existed. Puzzled, so I called Samsung again. This time the tech told me that I would need a 2.1 A charger. The 1 A charger only works for cellphone. Duh! Am I just too dumb or Samsung assumes that every customer should be geeky enough to know that! I mean, it is never mentioned in the user manual.  After my frustration was gone I looked around for a suitable adapter. This Lenmar one has good ratings on Amazon. At about the same time I came across another site that sold it for only 8 bucks. What a steal! The shipment came in today and I didn't waste another min to try it. Bingo! It works for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, and I was able to charge two tablets at the same time. I am so satisfied with my purchase. Two things that stand out for this Lenmar: (1) It is much smaller than my other adapter. It measures no longer than 3 3/4 inches in length. (2) The connections both at the USB side and the terminal side (where you plug into your car) are both very snug. No worry about the connection getting loose when you encounter a bump on the road.

I returned my first Nexus 4 and peeled the protector off so I could reapply it to my second Nexus.I did just that and the protector on the front was horrendous. It was CONSTANTLY being pulled up by my case and getting covered in dust. There was almost zero adhesive. I ended up taking it off again and cutting off all the corners a few millimeters to help it. It worked okay, but it was still coming up in areas and getting dust.Also, it seems as if dust is getting onto the protector itself (not just on the back because of my taking it on and off, the FRONT) and going into it. The clarity is horrible.I eventally got sick of it all and ripped off the front (the back is still on relatively well) and I just ordered a 14 dollar XO Skin. I have XO skins on my tablet and my iPod touch. I have had my iPod touch for 2 years with the XO Skin and it is still on great and the clarity of it is miles beyond the XtremeGuard.On top of all of this, I have noticed that the skin itself is much thinner and less durable than my XO Skins. The Skinomi TechskinSkinomi TechSkin - LG Nexus 4 Screen Protector Ultra Clear Shield + Full Body Protective Skin + Lifetime Warrantylooks much thicker and more durable than the Xtremeguard. The Skinomi also has the adhesive spray, which I think would help for the adhesive issue.Even on top of that, the front is not cut very well. The skin was covering up the proximity sensor on the Nexus making calls difficult because the screen would dark out (because it thinks it is up to your face when the proximity sensor sees that it is covered. This could have easily been remedied if I took it off and moved it in place, but what happens if I take it off? All the above.To sum up the review, DO NOT BUY THIS. If you still do buy it, don't take off the screen protector after you have installed it. Most of my problems would not have happened if I had not taken it off. I think the clarity issue, however, is a legitimate issue for anyone with this protector.Now I have no expierience with the Skinomi, but it looks more durable, it has adhesive spray, and it can protect the sides. Save yourself trouble and spend a few more dollars on it or buy or more reputable screen protector like the XO Skin or a Zagg screen protector.</td><td>List(1, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1794915660216645, 0.8205084339783355))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Purchased from Mediabridge Products, LLC and fulfilled by Amazon.

If it were not for Amazon I would be stuck with the terrible Apple-issued charger that my phone came with, because I would not want to pay $50 for a new charger.  But enough of that.I am glad to have the length and color options (although I am boring and just get black & white).  When I travel, I need the extra length because the Apple charger never reaches long enough and the extra couple feet with this cord is very helpful.  I am sure that some people enjoy all the colorful options.As for traveling, however--I purchased this cord and the wall plug right before I went out of town.  I had used the cord for a week at most, and been gentle with it--done nothing crazy like trying to use it to climb out of a well.  Then it broke!  First it started saying it was not compatible with my phone.  Then the part where the lightning connector is mounted in the plastic became loose and then totally disconnected and got stuck in my phone! I had to use a pair of tweezers to get it out.  My phone was not damaged, but the cord was obviously done.  SO I had to buy another one at the airport--and the only ones they had were the SAME Belkin ones, but I had to pay the regular jacked up Belkin/Airport price!I will say that the new cord, I have had no problems and I have had it for three months now .  Amazon refunded the old one with no problems.  It could have possibly been a dud--it happens, I guess.  My recommendation?  Buy it here if you need it--but make sure you use it right away to make sure it does not break and you can return it if you got a bad one like me.  And if there are too many returns then maybe Amazon or Belkin or someone might see there is a problem.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.787743591421383, 0.2122564085786171))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Shipping was quick but the product didn't come in nexus 4 packing.

Turns out, I love them! The fit is perfect for me, the clips for over-the-ear wear are perfectly designed and easy to install, under the ear they are great. I had some issues getting them to pair with my MacBook Pro, but after a couple of tries it worked out perfectly. The sound on these things is brilliant. Is it the best sound for an audiophile? Maybe not. From a bluetooth headset designed with working out in mind, these block so much sound that I'm almost concerned about someone sneaking up on me while I'm out running.My only concern is the charging port door seems flimsy, and I'm afraid that it may snap off at some point, but JayBird has been a good customer service company so far, so I'm not too worried. Would I have paid the 170$ish asking price from most stores? Probably not. I got them on a whim because they were on sale and I was in the market, but the JF3's were my next option and are cheaper than these even on sale.Also, Heavy sunglasses can cause problems with these staying in for running. I used to wear X-Metal type oakleys that would rest on the wires when these headphones were in the over-ear position, which weighed the wires down and generally got in the way of where the wires are supposed to rest causing them to pop out. When I switched to lighter weight running sunglasses these stay put just fine, I only have to reposition them once or twice for hour long runs.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9494097282452374, 0.05059027175476256))</td><td>1.0</td><td>The car charger works but unfortunately the cord is not compatible with apple products and doesn't work.

Once set in place on the dash the mount is not easily movable which is good in that it is designed to hold large phones but bad if you need to move it quickly.The software worked as described but their are a few items that could be improve.  When the dock software is set to send the audio out the cable it works but when you remove the phone from the dock the software resets all of the changes that it makes except for redirecting the audio (this is non-phone call audio).  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth settings  are returned to pre-docking settings but the music stream audio is not. I do not know if it is iBolt or Android but it would be nice if the phone calls could be routed to Bluetooth while the dock is set to send the audio thru the cable rather than to the phone's speaker (maybe I just didn't get the settings correct).If you drive a lot this is a good set up as it keeps you phone charged and lets you use it as a GPS, a music player and a phone all hands free.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.4913188787070695, 0.5086811212929306))</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great dock that is built well and provides a nice holder for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.

Part of this is due to the size of the phone.  The phone itself is barely as wide as a credit card, so it is hard to find a wallet case that works well as a wallet and a phone case for this phone.  All that said, I have been pleased with this case over others I have tried.The credit card side is great in that it will hold 4 cards well and still stay closed.  I have not had any trouble with tearing or fraying on that side like I have on other wallet cases for my iPhone.  I particularly like the longer closing strap and stronger magnet that this case has compared to others I have tried.  It is difficult to put much cash in there, but again that is due to the size of the phone.  If the case were big enough to hold much money, you wouldn't want it as it would then be bulky and you wouldn't want to carry it.  This case has so far struck the best balance between functionality and aesthetics of any of the wallet cases I have tried so far.The only drawback I have had so far has been that since the actual phone holder is only glued down to half of the side it is on (one of the reasons I chose this case) it makes the plastic holder not as sturdy.  As one of those folks that drop my phone from time to time, I have managed to crack the part that holds the phone on the side that is not glued down.  Even so, it has done a good job of protecting the phone through those drops.  This case may be a knock off of a more expensive case, but I couldn't be happier.  I am thinking of ordering another one, since I have cracked this one.  Not that I have to yet, it is a small crack, but for the price, why not?  I am even thinking of getting a couple of other colors at this price.  After all they are cute too.UPDATE: 8-25-13 I ordered a second case this time it was a different color and a slightly different style.  The cases available are different prices, this time I got one of the 9.99 cases instead of one of the $3ish cases. Amazon sees it as the same case I guess since it is from the same listing, so I am unable to write a separate review.  It came in quick even though it was sent USPS; however the plastic box inside the envelope had been crushed with obvious marks and indentions in the case.  This is obvious shipping damage.  I have submitted it for return via the Amazon return system; the vendor has 48 hours to respond.  I will update this review as soon as I have received a response to the return request.UPDATE: 8-27-13  I received an email yesterday from the seller telling me\"We are sorry to hear about the broken item. I am afraid it could be damaged during transition, especially for long distance delivery.We have reported this to our warehouse department for future improvement on packing the item.Would you please take a picture of the broken item? We need it for record purposes and also to avoid the necessity of returning it for inspection. Hope you can understand.You can rest assured that we will investigate this issue and provide a good solution for you immediately once we confirm the case.\"A little unexpected but, we will see how it goes.  Sending the email today.  Will update again with the resolution when it occurs.UPDATE: 9/10/13  We went on vacation for a week for the holiday and when I returned home there was a new case in the delivered mail my neighbor had brought in.

Incredicharge gets a bonus star for including the built-in micro USB cable (which is what powers most of my devices) but looses a star for not including some kind of carry pouch.

Thus I only have to bring my ipod's charger & the micro-to-miniUSB converter head (included) & i'm all set for my media charging needs!  2 usb ports are handy, so I could charge 3 items at the same time.  Supposed to automatically turn off when finished charging things.  1 downside is that it automatically turns off if i use it to power my portable speaker.  Doesn't do that when charging ipod, iphone, etc, but only when used as a power source to run the portable speaker.  Even with this quirk, I'd buy more as gifts.  Cannot yet find an inexpensive compact travel case for it.... so I'm using an external HD case in the meantime.Updated review:Initially I was quite pleased, but after careful usage, the power button broke (no I did not drop it) rendering the fully charged battery useless. If you don't press the power button you cannot charge anything.  I could hear the broken part rattle inside. Contacted the manufacturer via google search, via contact email, no phone contact available. Next day reply that they were on holiday (in October) for a week.  Even after their holiday ended, no follow up.  I did not want to wait.  Praises to Amazon customer service as they allowed the return and gave me a full refund and the staff did great follow up.  Just for fun, recontacted manufacturer, and they did respond the next day offering replacement, but said nothing about the shipping.  Good thing I did not gift this to others.  If your power button does not break, you will have a handy compact heavy charger, if it does break it is likely Incredicharge will be able to help you but without speed.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8832351128712645, 0.1167648871287355))</td><td>2.0</td><td>Loved this case at first- very stylish & heavy duty, a rare combination!

These are serviceable.  They don't go very loud, and the signal tends to cut out if you place too much of your body in the way.

Since then, I've been researching battery cases for my 5s and found the Maxboost. It seemed to be the right balance of features and price. I've used it for a couple days and I'll be returning it and buying the one linked above.PROS- I did not experience any signal loss like other reviews.- beautiful, minimalist design blends in perfectly with the phone and at a glance, you can't tell there's a case on it.- nicely slim and light; a friend commented that it's the slimmest battery case he's seen.- it 'feels' expensive due to its material, a type of plastic that is rigid but feels soft to the touch. this also makes the case have a matte finish which some people might really like.- the charging works as promised, which is very cool: when you plug the assembly in with the included cord, the case charges the phone first and then the case, so they're both ready to go when charging is done.CONS- that 'soft touch' plastic makes the case very slippery. some people might like that material, but I don't.- the bumper is also make of that plastic, which is an odd choice. bumpers can be purchased as a separate accessory and I've never seen a bumper made out of this type of material, because it's slippery. 'normal' shiny plastic has a more tacky feel against skin yet can still be made to look nice.- that bumper doesn't quite snap on completely at the bottom corner near the headphone jack. like other battery cases of this design, the phone docks into the battery back and then the bumper keeps the whole assembly together. the bumper is held on with tiny tabs, and the one on the bottom near the headphone jack doesn't grip the bumper, resulting in an assembly that isn't as 'tight' as it should be.- the kickstand is really just silly. it's VERY difficult to snap open (and if you have no fingernails, forget it), and once you get it open, it feels like it will snap off with very little help. it bears mentioning that the kickstand does NOT work in portrait mode; it only works when the phone is in landscape mode. that behavior is common to all cases of this design.- the micro USB port is very close to the bottom, on the side of the case. if you hold the phone in your right hand, you will not be able to hold it comfortably while it is charging. I believe this is a design flaw; the port should have been on the bottom in the same place as the lightning connector on the phone.- the bumper has cutouts to access the phone control buttons, but the thickness of the bumper makes the buttons difficult to get to.I know there are certain sacrifices one makes when using a case like this (weight, thickness, button and headphone jack access) but there are other battery cases that get the design closer to a better balance.

After using this product for about two weeks, it seems that when I charge my phone it shows No Service and stops working until I stop charging with the battery.

After all the negativity on here i decided against it. then i regretted that, bought it in a local store for full retail and wish i had NOT listened to the people on here. I upgraded from a Defender series case. i have NEVER used my phone without an otterbox... EVER.Here's some facts from a normal person. I use my phone as a (shocker) PHONE. I also use it for mapping, weather, Facebook, and gaming. Occasionally i will watch a youtube video on it, sometimes i will use it to show someone an awesome song. I have done all of these things since i got this case and here are the facts:Calls - I have made and received calls using just the handset and people i spoke with had no clue i had a case on my phone. I was able to hear the conversation with no problem whatsoever.Gaming - I have had no loss of functionality anywhere on the screen. Anywhere i touch for my game reacts the same as if the case wasn't thereMusic/Videos - Is there some sound loss? yes. Is it &#34;omfg horrible!&#34; no. If you are using your phone as a portal music device with no external speakers, i submit there is something wrong with you to begin with. But lets not go there. If you are using your phone for the occasional youtube video now and again or listening to a song to show a friend then listen up. 1) pop the plug cover off the bottom, the sound returns to normal. don't complain &#34;then its not waterproof anymore&#34; why are you listening to music in wet conditions anyway? WHY?! If you are a sane person, go indoors, pop the cover open and you have full sound again. However even with the cover on, i was able to hear my wife watching a video i showed her on facebook, from 3 ROOMS AWAY (vol max) So showing someone a nifty new song or video, and you require super max volume, then yes pop the cover on the bottom. otherwise the sound volume will be reduced by about 30%.Ringtone, while in an area with loud ambiance (like in the cab of a tractor trailer, traveling down the highway) you are going to miss calls... UNLESS you also have vibrate on then you will be fine. Truth be told i couldn't hear the damn thing even before this case. However if you spend most of your time at home or in quieter situations like the office or what have you. you wont noticed a problem at all.  Furthermore i submit some of these reviewers require a dictionary, as the sound &#34;quality&#34; is NOT reduced. the sound &#34;volume&#34; is. so your music and videos sound just fine only slightly quieter.Pros:-Dust Proof? YES this was tested to the extreme recently when several pounds of cement dust poured onto my pant leg and subsequently my phone. the case kept it all out, and was easy to clean-Water Proof? i have not thrown my phone into a bucket of water or went surfing with it (seriously, scroll through the reviews, some dingbat went surfing with their phone); However i am 100% confident that in a rainstorm if i had to make a call with it, or if i was splashed with water in the pocket i carry it in, i wouldn't worry.-Crush Proof? I have leaned on it, laid on it, and various forms of putting pressure on it while at work (my job can be rough some days) and at 350lbs, i can assure you this case did not give. would i run it over with my car? why on earth would i do that?-Drop proof? my defender survived multiple bounces (in one drop) and falls from up to 8 feet; i feel confident this will too.-Normal Everyday use (by which i mean, you use it normally) while protecting against a beating of external forces, absolutely.-Easy to remove. In the event you wanted to use a dock, or other phone accessory temporarily (ie: the iphone mount for nerf guns; or a docking station for a party) the phone can be removed by unclasping the 2 clasps that are there, and removing the back. its just that simple.Cons:-Sound Volume? It is reduced by roughly 25-30% Why? because to be water/dust proof the phone must be completely 100% encased. Between thin layers of plastic and thick outer layers to defend against shocks, drops, spills, and thrills, this phone is 100% protected from anything but bullets and explosions.-Buttons. Home button is no issue. Volume + - take a little more pressure to activate; and admittedly the Silent Mode switch on the side is &#34;troublesome&#34; or more accurately takes a little effort to work. But to me that's a small price to pay for a water/dust proof phone.-Carry. While the defender comes with a nice belt case, this one requires an additional $20 purchase to get a belt case for it. Out of the box it is strictly a case. However in recent months i have been carrying my phone in a pocket anyway, so this transition was flawless when i got this one. It fits in a standard (t-shirt) pocket, Pants pocket, or even an AR mag pouch (my tactical pants have magazine pockets in them) snugly and securely.So all in all this is a case that every iPhone 4/4s or 5/5s (different case) should be in. While there is a couple cons, the average person will have no issue at all with a case like this. if you are using your phone as a radio all the time, then get an external speaker or headphones if its that big of a deal to you.</td><td>List(72, 74)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9857022973651168, 0.014297702634883084))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I like the streamlined nature of this cover and the aesthetics.

The one I ordered from Amazon connecting fabric strip (ie the folding leather like piece that transitions the cover to the back) is much sturdier on the second one).Additionally, while both covers attach to the back through the use of a plastic strip, the cover purchased from Amazon appears to be more deeply imbedded in the back and appears to be more secure.

I may have been a bit hard on it as initially I was confused in looking at what was in the package: a clear template (resembling a screen protector meant to serve for: cut out a foto, design on paper, whatever to decorate back of clear case to individualize it) and what appeared to be poor craftsmanship of both blk bumper frame and clear back due to clear protective film (peel away) which somewhat overlapped the blk/clear border making it appear in a quick study that the clear plastic on back wasn't mesh within the blk frame of bumper which really looked cheap.  Long and short of it, this wasnt the case and I  made a snap judgment really not detailing enough as to why I thought is was worth only $4.  However, I stand by my initial review of the blk plastic bumper being very cheaply crafted.  The rubberized coating on blk bumper's plastic is so thin; it should have been coated more thickly to prevent slippage and give a semblance of being able to take a hit.  In trying to make this as slender (as they probably wanted)they really messed up what might have been a really nice, affordable product-in addition to cheaping out on the blk bumper to an extreme and making it feel more thin plastic (not a good kind) than tough.  The other big concern in addition to material on bumper is the very thin bezel on both L & R sides. This was the deal breaker for me finally as I felt, I paid for this, maybe it can be a 2nd case as back up. The glass surface of Nexus was just too close to these thin,low sizes of bumper. It does help that each of 4 corners are raised a bitif you set it on its back always.  But the thinness of L&R sides wasn't comforting for me and I always set my phone glass down upon it and feel better.  The positive, the clear backing seems well made and thick enough and is supposed to be anti-scratch-it also isn't slippery and can set it down and feel safe.  Port cut outs are good, don't worry about fit, its snug but you don't have to wrestle with it to get it in or out and feel like youre gonna hurt your wonderful new phone.  Finally, I know we all want to save, honest, I sure do but the adage \"you get what you pay for, rings in my ears.\"  Many are ok w/product here and no judgment...but its a new $350-400 phone, spend more than $8 to save a drop.  The price keeps dropping for a reason...its only worth $6-8.  I took the risk, the pic and name grabbed me.  Bought it at $10 too.  Its opened now and protective film taken off so definitely cant return but I wont be risking my Nexus in it. (Maybe sell or give away, I know I wont use it). I did buy the Cruzerlite too by the way and feel its a much better product.  Its very protective, rubberized and the lip is 2x as thick when you set it face down as I like to. Its I feel very confident in its ability to protect my phone.  I tried both side by side too so Im not trying to sell anyone on this particular brand. Ive also used Otterbox hybrid case on My 2010 HTC One, great protection, expensive but also bulky, rubber silicone heated up internals but dropping-no issue. I didnt like its bulk so I slowly removed ext hardshell, then the silicone as it aged and cared freely in pkt. I found over the yrs and new phones, spending a lot on accessories is a losing game. I love my tech gear tho' so I try to live in the middle: not to cheap, not too expensive (more minimalistic too).  I hope this review reflects a balanced overview of this product for all. Im happy to give you mine, just email here and send a postage paid envelope. ;)</td><td>List(12, 28)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5069509549230414, 0.4930490450769587))</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is my second and it works perfectly.

It just happens that this version is all-around good and the very few negatives don't amount to much - fingerprint magnet is really the only one I can think of.So here it is why I love this model (I do):&#10004; HIGH CAPACITY: at 8400mAh it can charge a phone a couple of times, perhaps more so, once you fill it up with juice you can simply drop it in your bag and it's ready to use when you need it.&#10004; COMES WITH ITS OWN CHARGER: most chargers on the market rely on you providing your own wall charger, which is not hard but, still, the one included is a welcome frill and it just happens to be smaller than most third party so I'm glad it's included.&#10004; INTERFACES GALORE: read Amazon's description but, just in case you don't want to bother, the iFLASH comes with a modular system that has a USB Type-A at one and it allows you to attach any of the supplied interfaces at the other end such as Mini USB, Micro USB, PSP (true), Nokia DC 2.0, iPhone/iPad (old style) and, of course, you can supply your own wire if none of these fit your device.&#10004; DUAL CHARGING PORTS: they are the standard 0.6A for most phones and 2.0A for tablets but also usable to charge a phone faster. And they could be used concurrently (very nice).&#10004; COMES WITH A BAG: this is very important to me. You are not going to take everything with you but the nice black bag can easily hold the iFLASH, the wall charger and the few wires and plugs you may need for your devices.&#10004; CHARGE INDICATOR RINGLIGHTS: they light up when you press a button and 4 blue rings mean 100% full, 3 rings mean 75% full and so forth.&#10004; LITTLE LED FLASHLIGHT: just in case. Who knows, you may find yourself in complete darkness and this just might save the day.And, again, no significant negatives. Yes, it's not going to win any prize at an industrial design competition but even the looks are quite decent. If you are looking for a charger that works well and comes with everything you need, this one is very good choice. I didn't measure how many minutes it took this iFLASH to charge my phones or little tablets but charged it did and it did it quickly and, once all I needed was in the bag already I didn't have to waste time looking for little wires or plugs.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9977637268935902, 0.0022362731064097816))</td><td>1.0</td><td>First of all the title does not explain in Lay man terms that this pen works ONLY on the INTERNATIONAL version of the Samsung Galaxy 3.

Track control is not possible from speaker docks with remote controls.  There is no support for ID3 music tags.My primary goal with this unit since it said it supported AVRCP profile was to have it in my car on the ipod 30pin dock so I could use it with my Android phone.  Nissan head unit would not even enable the ipod input: &#34;ipod not present&#34; or &#34;no ipod present&#34;I also wanted to be able to use the Nissan head unit to read ID3 tags and maybe even select playlists.  This is all do-able with Tx-Rx data liens on the 30pin dock and adapter along with AVRCP and additional bluetooth profiles.  But this was NOT included in the function of this adapter.  it appears to ONLY support power and analog audio pins on the 30pin docks.Vendor was VERY helpful and accepted and refunded my return.

I was wrong. Amazons price was $113. That was only $12 less than the Lunatik site, so I figured that it would be authentic. WRONG! The case arrived quickly, but its packaging was falling apart and did not look like the packaging of the real one. I knew right away that it was the fake one that is all over the Internet and can be bought for about $30. The bezels were made from poorly cast aluminum with casting marks all over them and a cheap black paint job. The Lunatik branding was painted on instead of stamped into the case. The built-in glass screen protector was poorly glued in and I highly doubt it was Gorilla Glass. It also had a very bad &#34;oil slick&#34; effect.  The rubber inner part was very flimsy and did not fit the phone very well. The camera cut-out was one opening instead of individual openings for the flash, camera lens and noise canceling mic. The bottom flap did not stay closed either.  The material that is supposed to be water resistant that covers the speakers looked like some kind of cheap cloth instead of Gortex. The front bezel cut out for the earpiece, light sensor and front facing camera is also different. I believe Amazon is knowingly selling these, because when I requested to return it, my credit card had been credited back the full amount before I even sent the package back. Amazon is great with the returns, but I have never received a refund until after they received a product back.I ended up ordering the real one directly from Lunatik. I received quickly and it was packaged very well. The real case is outstanding and worth every dime it cost. Shame on Amazon for selling a cheap imitation. I may have to consider renewing my Prime account next time around.</td><td>List(35, 42)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8706691453578417, 0.12933085464215843))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Phone gets very hot, almost to the point you feel it would burn things.

I've tried several; some were promising, but had fatal flaws, while others were just downright stupid concepts.I had really high hopes for this case; Otterbox makes really good cases, and I felt sure they'd knock it outta the park with this case. While it does have some good features that I liked, it also has some flaws. One flaw in particular is fatal flaw, and for that one, I'm returning the product.Pros:It IS waterproof - I kept it submerged for over an hour in my bathroom sink, and the inside stayed dry.The case is surprisingly easy to open and close back up - I REALLY liked that.Ports are easy to open and close.No 'moisture spots' developed between the inside of the case screen and my device screen. That was HUGE in my book.Exterior speaker worked really well. In fact, was louder than the built-in S3 external speaker.Touchscreen was very sensitive.Cons:The thing is HUGE beyond reasonable.When I latched the case shut, the back piece was 'bowed'. Let me try to explain - the case is in two pieces - the front piece, where the phone lives, and the back plate. The back plate has teeth along one long edge that fit into matching slots in the front piece. Align the teeth and slots, and press the two pieces together. Then use the metal latches to fasten them tight. That's when the 'bowing' shows up - at least it did with my unit. After closing the latches, I'd look at it from the top and bottom edges, and could see that while the two long edges were drawn tightly together, the middle of the back plate was bowed outward, so there appeared to be a gap between the two. The gap apparently didn't leak, but it was an obvious side effect of the latching process that constantly made me nervous.While the external speaker worked well, it is a weak spot. It is made up of a lightweight screen on the exterior of the case, and a rubber-like diaphragm on the inside. The diaphragm vibrates like a speaker cone, and transmits music or telephone conversations really well. My fear is that this could easily be punctured, allowing moisture in that could ruin the device inside.The buttons are STIFF, and required hard presses to get them to work. The Back and Menu softkeys are hard to reach and not responsive. Surprising, since the main touch screen is so sensitive.Telephone - this is where the case really sucks. Be prepared to literally shout to make yourself heard. If you actually intend to listen to the other party, you better put in your headphones. Absolutely the worst thing about this case, and for me was the dealbreaker.The S3 has a proximity sensor feature that turns off your display when you hold the phone to your ear, and turns it back on when you take the phone away. This feature is disabled entirely while the case is on my phone. In fact, I'm not able to disconnect from calls until the other party hangs up. I refuse to start turning off phone features because my case renders them unworkable. At $95 this case better allow my phone features to work correctly.Maybe Otterbox will fix these flaws - another reviewer said he contacted Otterbox customer support who sent him out a new case that fixed the proximity sensor problem. Hopefully one day they'll fix the issue where I can't hear the caller or shout so the caller can hear me while on a phone call.</td><td>List(10, 16)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.558613870334738, 0.441386129665262))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Short story: if you're looking for a nice dock for your phone while you sit at your desk, this accessory is really nice!When I'm in my office, I don't like anything in my pockets.  No keys, no flash drives, nothing.  That goes for phones too.  The Bolse Desktop Charger Dock is really nice if you are in your office and you'd like to charge your phone.  The charger has a no-frills design, so it's not gaudy, and it won't attract any weird attention.  Besides simply charging your phone, there's a few other features that are pretty cool too:Charger Your Battery.  Apart from charging your phone, you can also charge a separate Samsung Galaxy battery.  The battery will fit snugly behind where your phone docks.  The charge rate on this is pretty quick too, so if you want to ensure you have a spare battery along with you, it's really easy to implement.Access Your Phone.  Your Samsung Galaxy has a nice display, and the Bolse charger dock will let you access it while charging.  While in the charging dock, it stands upright, so that you can easily access utilities on your phone while you are at your desk.  This works really well for almost any function: if you want to place a call, browse the web, listen to music, etc... If you just want your phone to display the time (so that it behaves like a really expensive clock,) you can do that too.Line Out Capabilities.  The back of the charging dock has a line-out port, so if you want to listen to anything through speakers or headphones, you can do that easily.  If you like to stream Pandora, Amazon Music, Google Music, you can do so without it blaring over your phones speakers.Overall, if you have a Samsung Galaxy, this is a great accessory to own.  It won't crowd your desk, and it offers a nice station to dock your phone while you are docked at your desk.  It wouldn't be bad for a bedside dock either!

During a call, I heard a loud \"click\" every few seconds, and could not accurately hear what was being said to me.  There seemed also to be radio interference when the phone was near other electronics, such as my computer.  If I was sitting at my computer talking on the phone, I heard a background buzz like an old FM radio too close to the television (for those of you old enough to remember) and the \"CLICK\" was amplified (much louder).(2) I used a SIM card for T-Mobile's network.  The particular networks I was trying to use were 2G and 3G bands 850 and 1900.  When I configured the APN pursuant to my carrier's requirements, I could NOT use MMS (in other words, I couldn't send and receive photos in text messages).  I used my carrier's technical support to ensure that I did it right, and after walking me through APN settings for the T-Mobile network, I found out there were two ways to configure it - and I had tried both before.  We (tech support and I) tried them a few times just in case, and we tried various work-around attempts, but this Windows Phone 8 would not permit MMS.Other bad stuff:(1)  There was a general lack of Apps.  Worse, the native Nokia Navigation App was awful.  It tried to send me to a Home Depot that was 23 miles away.  I live in the middle of the City of San Diego and there are at least four Home Depot stores that are much closer, one is 2.3 miles away, another less than 5 miles away, and the other two within 15 miles.  I don't even know if there WAS a Home Depot 23 miles away where it tried to take me because I was testing the App and didn't actually drive to a Home Depot, though I was driving around when I set it up.  There were other Navigation Apps available in the Windows Phone 8 App store, but each cost a few bucks, none were familiar, so a user would have to buy the App and test it, and if it didn't work, I don't know how the user would address that issue.  I could see pages of paid Navigation Apps - you could spend another $50 or $100 or more buying Navigation Apps until you found one that worked, unless you got lucky and bought one for $1.99 and it works as well as the one that comes on my Android or my buddy's iPhone both which are included (and I have two free ones that came installed on my Android, both which work very well).(2)  Battery life was awful, BUT it is a removable battery so that wasn't a deal killer.  If the quality of the calls would have been even decent; if it would have sent and received MMS; and if it would have had basic apps available that worked well; a user could buy an extra battery and charge it separately and always have power - I've always had phones with removable batteries so I don't find myself out of juice.Good stuff:(1)  After properly configuring the APN, the Internet worked very, very well.  Pages came up in a blink of an eye whether I was connected to Wi-Fi or whether I used data from the T-Mobile network.(2)  Transferring the content from my phone (contacts and photos) was very easy and very fast.(3)  Syncing my phone with my Windows Live account was a breeze and it was also very easy to also connect and sync with Google to add to contacts.(4)  The phone LOOKS great and feels good in my hands.(5)  Navigating the menus and using the Windows 8 Phone software was easy and intuitive.  Even finding APN settings and editing them was straightforward even if it took me a little bit of time to find them - but that's like any smart phone - there are a lot of categories to look through in the phone's settings menus.In Summary, I was flabbergasted that both Nokia and Microsoft rolled out such a deficient product.  Given that the Internet worked so very well and that the phone had a lot of power to quickly load beautiful web pages, I can't believe that the people who engineered this hardware and software even use cell phones.  I can guarantee that no one of any upper corporate status owns or uses this or any other cell phone because if they did, they would have demanded a useful set of native, installed, working apps.  They would know that us \"regular people\" use MMS, it's important to us even if for nothing but fun (but also, that's useful for work - to send photos of \"stuff\" back to the office for immediate response).  They would know that anyone whose owned a smart phone for a few years requires voice Navigation that works.  They could have used GOOGLE maps and written a good App for WinPhone8.  But they didn't.  They released a phone (and I read the reviews on the other Nokia Lumia Windows 8 Phone - none of them had good Apps and many people had difficulty getting MMS service) which I guess they feel they can repair over time with software push updates, or maybe not.  I returned this phone and sold my stock in both Nokia and Microsoft.  This product and the whole Lumia line looks like a losing bet made by lazy, incompetent, rich fools who aren't hungry enough and too arrogant to make sure the product they release works in the manners that people are known to use it.  They are both far out of touch with reality if they think people will enjoy using these devices.</td><td>List(4, 39)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5652600987871967, 0.4347399012128032))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Short story: if you're looking for a nice dock for your phone while you sit at your desk, this accessory is really nice!When I'm in my office, I don't like anything in my pockets.

An LED light notes when the charging is occurring (taking the guess work out of plugging things in only to return a few hours later and finding that nothing has been charging!), and once a charge is complete the charger automatically stops.The four ports are designated for best use. Ports 1 and 2 are universal and will charge everything, Port 3 is used for older models that may not respond to ports 1 and 2, and Port 4 is designated for Samsung products (except for iPad). All USB charging cables will fit.For those who have tried this wall charger the vote is in that it is reliable and works well. There is a one-year warranty that gives you the sense that the company stands behind their promises. So for the convenience of charging multiple devices simultaneously  - iPhone, iPad, HTC phones, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Samsung Galaxy Phone, Samsung Galaxy Note, Blackberry, MP3 players, Digital Camera etc - this sis a wise investment.

The blue light for charging blinks until it's full and then remains solid, while the red light is similar for discharging... very helpful. I also like that it can charge itself and charge another device simultaneously, by using both the input and output ports.The PROBLEM is that this thing broke down quickly. After only about two months of light usage, it doesn't charge, discharge, or light up. Sorry, but that's way too short of a lifetime.I'll update my review with more positive remarks if I'm able to return and replace it with a new unit.UPDATE: I had difficulty getting in touch with Photive, but once they found my review on Amazon, they were very helpful and shipped me a brand new one immediately.

The Defender holster clip popped open, so I returned it.  Then looked for an equivalent protective case, and ended up back with the Defender, only this time refusing to trust their holster.  I bought a Klein Tools 5715 PowerLine Black Nylon Mobile Phone Holder, Large and that worked fairly well, though the holster is too large for the Defender and after about 10 days, the clip came off my belt when tangled in my seatbelt.  I am now using this leather pouch case and have also purchased a pair of cargo pants to see how that works (pretty well so far).This pouch fits the Defender well.  One review noted that it is difficult to get the phone out of the case, however there is an open area on the bottom corners where one can simply push the phone up a ways, and then grasp it from the topside.  Thus the close fit is not a problem to me.My reason for not giving this 5 stars is that the loops for the belt appear thin and I am anticipating they will not last a year.  I think the cargo pants will work better, but then cargo pants are not for all occasions.Update 5/8/14The loops have held up better than I anticipated.  That is due in part to the fact that the clip between the loops aids in holding the case on the belt.However, I have found that around the edges, the black polish comes off too easily.  Thus, leaving it at 4 stars.I also want to note that there is a piece of elastic to permit getting one's fingers into the slot to retrieve the phone.  Obviously some people still have trouble getting the phone out, but there has been something put in place to assist that process in addition to the above noted holes.</td><td>List(9, 11)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.26605935027195887, 0.7339406497280412))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I ordered this brand because I have had good results with one of their portable chargers.

Haven't reached a resolution yet. Lets see if their promise for lifetime replacements holds up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I now have a fine hairline scratch atop the tempered glass. I've been babying the phone since installation and the only place its been is in my pocket or my desk. I dont think this is as hard or tough as they make it out to be. Will return it if I see more by the end of this week. Docking a star for now.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Have been buying Skinomi products for the past few years now. I've been installing their Screen Protectors on iPads, Nexus 4s, Moto X, Blackberry Z10's of my family members. They're hold up pretty well if you get the installation right - but eventually come off if you're one of those heavy users like my wife. And the lifetime warranty claim is a hassle - so never bothered.This is my first experience with their Tech Glass product. The installation went smooth, there are no bubbles and the feel of glass is far more refined than that of regular protectors. I can see there are some persistent marks at the top (where the glass starts) and these don't seem to be bubbles. I guess the plastic protector applied on the tech-glass (pre-installation film) was not done well.Will wait for a few days and reach out to Skinomi if they (marks) dont go away. Their customer service has always been top notch,Its a good buy though. Worth the extra spending when you invest in a 600 $ + phone.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.983342197863025, 0.01665780213697506))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I began following the HTC since it was first getting leaked that HTC was staging a comeback, and the HTC One was going to be their flagship device. I'm someone that always likes to jump on board with the latest and greatest and so I tried out the HTC One shortly after it came out. Despite my initial excitement and some positive aspects to the device and the software, I ultimately ended up returning it. I've tried to highlight the pros and cons below that led to my decision.Pros- Fantastic build quality: This is what an Android phone should be built like and it just feels fantastic to the touch. High quality materials all around - save for a few bands of plastic for the cellular and Wifi radios. Holding this in 1 hand and the SGS4 in the other makes it readily apparent which company went the extra mile to build something that feels solid in the hand.- Excellent screen: The color reproduction is by far the more accurate out of the recent crop of android devices on the market. I regularly use a color-calibration device on my computer monitors, so I pay particular attention to this. The unit I specifically got has a slight red-shift, but nothing that impairs the overall quality. It's definitely got more accurate color reproduction than the Samsung Galaxy S4, but some people might like the \"richer\" more saturated look that the SGS4 provides. Viewing angles are only about okay, but not a big issue for me since I'm the only one that uses this. The 1080p Resolution makes everything crisp and easy to read.- Above-average low-light performance: This phone overall does a better job than most other competitors in terms of low-light performance. I wish I could say it stands above the rest, but Nokia takes top honors in low-light and in terms of mixed lighting scenarios I still think the SGS4 is still a step up. See the cons for more information.- Good camera software: The Zoes feature is pretty cool and is a great way to create little clips or pick out the best image of the lot. It's easy to share and integrates well with existing social networks. It's one of the unique software features HTC offers, and is definitely one of the fun highlights that most people I show really enjoy playing with. I just wish it came with a dedicated camera button to make taking pictures a bit easier.- Great built-in speakers: The speakers that are built into the phone sound pretty solid if you're holding the phone in the standard portrait mode. It's great for sharing something with a friend when you're in a more public area and most phone speakers give out. Don't expect miracles from phone speakers, but as far as phone speakers go they are a step above the rest. The beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in your headphones, though it's more suitable for current pop and hip-hop music than for other genres.- Blinkfeed: Blinkfeed sort of integrates all of the news you care about into one convenient sliding panel. I tried it for a bit, and while it's convenient I also feel it was reducing my battery performance (no evidence of this), so I simply chose to ignore it. It's a great option for those of you that want to pull in information from all of your favorite sites into one area. I don't think there is a way to remove blinkfeed entirely, you can only choose to ignore it like I did. Still work trying out though!- Includes IR integration: This means the HTC can connect and control your TV, which is pretty handy when you can't find the remote. It's pretty basic in terms of the controls you get, but it works well in a pinch.- Solid wifi performance: I have a Asus AC-1750 802.11ac router and tested speeds on file transfers and media playback with the HTC One and it came through with flying colors. I was easily able to transfer a 1080p MKV movie file of around a few gigs in size in minute or 2. It's not as quick as the external 802.11ac adapters I have, but excellent for a phone.Cons- The metal build of this phone means that if it gets dropped it will definitely show some serious battle-scars, paint chipping, and dents. The SGS4, though plastic, does have durability going for it. It's a shame to feel like you have to invest in a case since it's such a good looking device, but I just don't feel safe about using this phone outside without one because it's so easy for someone to bump you accidentally and for this phone to get thrashed. The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light. While this is a fine solution to capture more light and give you better low-light performance, it's not the best choice for when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light. Frankly, I just didn't think the images were that great, and the lack of zoom while working with them on your desktop becomes readily apparent - especially if you like to crop your shots after taking them like I do. I personally think Nokia's implementation of using a ridiculously large megapixel sensor and combining multiple pixels to oversample is the better solution. Take a look at the new Nokia 1020 sample images and compare to see for yourself. If I had to buy a Android phone today and wanted the best overall camera - my nod goes to the SGS4.- Average battery life: While the capacity seems decent for a phone, because of the higher resolution and larger screen I've been seeing very average to poor battery life results. I've used it mainly on my daily commute, which involves listening to Pandora to and from work, checking gmail very regularly throughout the day, and using the calendar and GPS functions frequently. I do watch a tv show during the afternoon sometimes if I'm on the go, and make about a hour or 2 worth of phone calls a day. Put simply, I've bought a external battery pack and a spare charger with me everyday that I had this phone because if I wanted to go out after work I could not trust the HTC One to make it through. Every HTC device I've tried has had middling battery life, from the HTC Sensation to the HTC One X. It seems HTC hasn't changed much here, and it's a shame because the battery is sealed in, so I'm not at all confident about battery degradation over time.- No expandable storage: The 32gb that's built into this phone, with a fair amount used up for the HTC software, just isn't enough for power users. I load on a good deal of my own music and I used to just swap out movies and tv shows onto a microSD card slot to take on the go (thanks to data caps ruining the fun of streaming them on the go). I think 32gb will be fine for most people, but not having the option to expand like the SGS4 or Sony models just puts HTC one step below.- Still some lag: This phone has some really fast internals, and does indeed run very smoothly most of the time. Unfortunately, there are still those moments of slow-down and lag that have plagued Android handsets for a while that I at least still notice. This isn't going to be a 100% smooth experience, but it's not enough to severely impact the daily use of this phone. Just wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you that care.- Poor button placement: The power button is along the top part of the phone because it's integrated with the IR blaster, meaning it can be pretty hard to reach for those with smaller hands. Moreover, HTC decided to break the Android standard and include only the back and home button with a big non-functional htc logo in the middle. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed the logo expecting to go home, and this is something my friends have done too when playing with the phone. It's just a poor design decision.Ultimately for me the most important aspects of a phone are camera performance, screen quality, and battery life. In terms of camera-performance the HTC One is just not as good as the competition, and I cannot recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel (4MP) camera when there are better options available today and coming out soon. Screen quality on this phone is probably the best you can get in nearly all regards. And the battery-life is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough for me on what I consider moderate usage. Overall, if I had to own this phone for a few years, I wouldn't feel too happy about it. While the screen quality will hold up over time, the camera performance is already behind the competition and the battery life will only get worse as the battery degrades over time. I'm glad HTC is staging a comeback and this is a great first-step, but it's still got some work to do before I can recommend their devices for long-term ownership and satisfaction.</td><td>List(7, 10)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.005021974867738461, 0.9949780251322615))</td><td>5.0</td><td>APRIL 29, 2013:  I have had my One for 11 days and the experience has been great.  A beautiful device that you can show on your work desk.  Priot to getting it, my major concerns were not having a replaceable battery or M-SD card slot but have found out that was not necessary.  Phone's call quality is great, the front facing speakers are superb, allowing a true stereo effect and the display has been surprisingly good even outside in sunny days.  Perhaps, one of the things I like the most is the level of customization w/o using Carrier's applications or those from third parties.  Sense and blink are new to me but were customized also to my likes.  The camera has some innovative features which I have tried but is something I am not interested in a cell phone.Have been conducting some \"home tests\" on battery life and noticed that per the phone's battery indicator, its consumption might not be linear; it shows that most of the charge is used during the first few hours and below 50% takes more time to be consumed.  Nevertheless, downloaded today a couple of applications to monitor which applications are most important regarding battery use.  BTW, with average use making phone calls, text messaging, accessing e-mails and web browsing, have been charging the phone every 36 to 48 hours (similar to the Droid X).  I am not into social media or extreme texting.Worth mentioning that changing from my three year old Moto-Droid meant switching from VZN to ATT but still in the 14 day return period.  ATT's signal is not as good as Big Red but so far has worked for me (except when in underground places).  I have no objective elements to compare the One to the S-4 as have always considered Sammy's phones \"boring\", too wide and cheap looking; phones not for me.  The HTC One looks very well made and the combination of aluminum with glass and black background on the screen makes it very attractive for all those that have not seen the device in person.  So far is a \"keeper\" and if you have one, experiment customizing it, a really fun experience.May 12, 2013:  I have been using my HTC One for three weeks and writing article this as a follow up to the first review published on 04/29/13.  Overall the device has been flawless although the ATT signal is not as good as the one from VZN.  My One is a silver 64GB phone that was preordered and even arrived before the expected date.  After having used a Droid X (with VZN) for three years my major concern on getting the One was the non replaceable battery.  Probably I am one of the few users who have a spare charged battery for all portable devices as live in a hurricane prone area and in 2005 (due to Hurricane Wilma) was without communication for over a week.The One's 2,300 mAh battery has been surprisingly good.  I am not into Facebook or other social media and use the device as a Telephone, for MM messages, for Text Messaging, for E-Mails and the Sense feature is always looked at and many articles read (a really nice feature).  Occasionally can watch a video or take photos but does not happen every day.  Regarding the phone's settings, the Power Saver and Sleep mode are on as well as the Mobile data and the Bluetooth.  Wi-Fi is off as have other devices that I use on said mode and the current contract w ATT allows plenty of data.  So far the battery use has been as follows:* Moderate Use:  1 day 11 hours consumed 51% of the battery.  For me, Moderate use is 10-15 calls, 10 messages, Internet searching, Sense news and 10-12 photos.* Light use:  3 days 12 hours used 75% of the battery life.  Light use for me is 4-6 calls, 10 messages, Internet searching, Sense news and 3-4 photos.* Heavy use:  3 days 5 hours have taken 83% of the battery life.  This means calling everyone on Mother's Day (20+ calls) 4-6 messages, Internet, Sense and two photos.Having stated the above ratings, the HTC battery lasts much longer that what I had anticipated.  BTW, I am in an ATT 4-G area with excellent phone reception and most of the time with Bluetooth devices.  I charge the phone every other day or every third day and no power problems as of now.  Of all the great features of the device, my biggest surprise has been the battery duration.  And being 2013, so many awesome phones do not have a replaceable battery, such as the Nokias 920/928, some of the new VZN Androids and not to mention the Apple products which date from 2007 w/o a replaceable battery.  Nevertheless, there are many alternatives to supplement power on these devices by external sources by simply a common micro USB connection (available anywhere) or even from your car's charger or even the computer.I was recently reading some reviews on the 16GB Sammy S-4 and seem they are having issues with the native storage capacity, especially w the 16GB version.  The OS and Native applications do not allow users much storage.  I was intrigued by this issue and looked up my phone DCIM source and with all the apps, ringtones & photos I have customized, these take less than 5GBs of the 64 that the phone natively have.  But I have just one movie and not songs/albums playlists.And lastly, a recent controversy has been published as the One has not been updated from the Android 4.1 to the 4.2 platform.  Having verified both of these, it might be useless as the One performs great and the newest version on the S-4  has some gimmicks that may look fine but will be useless for most users.News have been published that now VZN is planning to have the One after they had declined it because of their homologue DNA.  But my dearest friends from Big Red, it is kind of late...  Many users such as me, switched the amazing VZN coverage for ATT because you decided on not having the latest fashionably and optimal device.  This happened with the Nokia 920 last year and with the infamous Apple products several years ago.  Perhaps is time for the Big Red guys to re-evaluate marketing strategies.  Good luck with that!

That said, wet applications are simply too messy & too risky as liquid can get inside the phone even if you're careful. I have seen wet applied protectors before and am not convinced they are superior to dry application in any way (strange rubbery/tacky feeling and aforementioned complications).

The connection on this one is so solid, that I found myself forgetting to take my phone off when the kids and I would stop on our bike ride (The Habit, Yogurtland, etc.) Note: the mount can be attached two ways: with 2 O-rings, or with zip-ties and the O-rings worked so well that I didn't even zip it on.In order to connect the phone, you simply pop it in a case and then pull down on the blue &#34;quad lock&#34;. Twist it on a quarter-turn, and then let the lock snap into place. One it's on, your phone isn't going anywhere. This system also allows you to put the phone in both landscape and portrait mode, depending on the application you're using.How am I using it?Initially, I used it for the GPS. My kids and I like to take bike rides though our community, and usually we just go out for X number of miles and then return. Our preference is to come home a different way than we came, so having the GPS right in front of me allows me to make decisions on the fly. In the past, I'd have to stop and plan our moves every once in a while, which spoiled the flow of our rides.After a few rides, I realized that the speaker on my phone was plenty loud enough to play music as we rode along. The phone doesn't get too loud, so it's not obnoxious like the beach-cruiser & ghetto-blaster combinations we see so much at the beach. I must say that I've lengthened many rides because my Pandora music mix was doing such a good job that I wanted to keep going.And finally, we like to use it for tracking our miles and rides using Runkeeper. This is great because we can set goals and tell our friends how much we rode.Note: The bike also comes with a clear cover for your phone. Because I didn't read about it, I assumed that it was necessary to have on the phone (it's just a clear top). While writing this review, I noticed that they call it a &#34;poncho weather resistant cover&#34; and that makes sense. When the case it on, the sensitivity of the screen is diminished but the case is really designed to put on if it were to start to sprinkle or if you were riding through muddy conditions. For it's intended purpose, it works great but if you won't be having these conditions, just leave it in your bag.Ultimately, this is a great, secure bike mount that works perfectly for my needs and looks great doing it. Because I write so many reviews, I don't often suggest products to my friends, but this will definitely be an exception. It's that awesome.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6130668844587174, 0.38693311554128257))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I've been buying screen protectors from Tech Armour for about a year but the HD kind.So I decided to try the anti-glare/anti fingerprint kind on my HTC One.Its been about 2 months.Installation was fairly easy with NO air-bubbles at all.Touch screen accuracy is no where near flawless.

This is my new favorite, beating the Otterbox Commuter handily and even my previous favorite, the Incipio DualPro (though I will still use the Incipio when I really need a slim form factor).The Aegis is grippy exactly where it needs to be.  The rubber layer is soft enough to cushion a fall, but stiff enough not to pull away from the phone too much.  I would rate the protection on the level of the Otterbox Commuter, but I prefer the Aegis for several reasons.  First of all, the rubber on the Commuter is too hard.  It makes the buttons really hard to press, with no feedback, and I think would not absorb the force of a fall well enough.  The front lip on both covers is similarly deep.  I never did have a problem opening the port covers on the Commuter, but the Aegis makes it especially easy by providing tiny tabs.  The Commuter is not grippy, and Otterbox didn't strategically place the rubber to make it so.The colored plastic part of the Aegis case isn't very grippy, but it doesn't need to be, because the rubber is in all the right places.  The little rectangle in the back center keeps it from sliding on the table.  I love that the corners are rubber.  Landing on a corner would really stress the phone, so having the softer material there should absorb more shock than if they'd had hard plastic in those spots.  Rubber corners and port covers were actually the two features I was seeking when I went looking for yet another case.Comparing to the Incipio Dual-Pro is a little harder, because both cases are good for the right use.  The Incipio is thinner and lighter, but sometimes you need that, even if it means less protection.  Ports aren't covered, the front lip is more shallow, and the case is thinner all around.  The Incipio is my second favorite and I plan to keep all three of those (yes, three).The ONLY thing I would change about the Aegis is the opening around the camera. I prefer a more form-fitting opening.  The case is very thick at that spot, though, which should help.You can't really see the screen dust cover over the microphone in pictures, but it's there, and a nice feature I haven't found in any other case.Overall, this beats the Otterbox Commuter, Maxboost Pro, Poetic Atmosphere (my least favorite), and even my beloved Incipio DualPro.  It adds a fair amount of weight, but that's an easy tradeoff in return for beefier protection.  They really should make this in white, which would look great on a white phone.  A case this great deserves more colors anyway.One other note on the subject of color.  I got the blue, which appears in the pictures to be royal blue.  In reality it looks more like a dark aqua.  Still a great look that I think would be fine for both genders.</td><td>List(9, 11)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9926391563505849, 0.007360843649415126))</td><td>2.0</td><td>Update (7/7/2014): I ended up returning the case as the rubber part of the case got more loose. See photo here: [...]I like the case in general and would keep it. The design looks good on a White S4.Minor issues:1. The case is smooth enough that fro the first few days I was really careful handling it. Now I have gotten used to it but it is on the smooth side. For example if you leave the phone on the middle console of the car (face up) it will move around as you drive.2. The issue that a few others mentioned about the rubber case fit it true. (see photo). The rubber case is not fully fitting all the edges of the phone. It looks a bit ugly. I have written to Incipio about this but so far the response is a generic response about a damaged case and needs replacement. It is not. This case needs to be a tiny bit shorter (length-wise) to be a good fit.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8184503418816047, 0.1815496581183953))</td><td>3.0</td><td>got the case and was excited about it untill noticed that kick-stand on the back of it was missing . just was too lazy to return it (((</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9996068145332211, 3.9318546677890226E-4))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I purchased the Nokia wireless car dock for the same reason as stated in the product name, wireless charging car dock.When I got the product I was surprised about the build quality and overall simplicity of the dock. It's sturdy, looks elegant and has a very nice lock feature that is very easy to use compared to other docks which use the manual clasping hands.The rubber side protectors are of high quality which you can barely notice and gets the job done while tightly grasping your device. A few hard shakes and the device remains in place but I would not always rely on this since over time it may just wear down.You can easily go from portrait to landscape with one hand but I felt that during landscape, the dock was a bit flimsy and seemed to want to return to portrait so your mileage may differ.The Qi base works as advertised as does the NFC but the base will get pretty hot especially if you are using GPS navigation (make sure to have the AC point at the dock's direction).The USB port on the cigarette lighter connector is a nice convenient touch but sadly slow charges btw devices.This is a nice and useful dock charger but unfortunately for me it was not compatible with my device.The dock is meant for Nokia phones but I have a Samsung Note 3 and it is not compatible.The dock is able to hold the note 3 even with a wallet case on but it cannot charge it because the note 3 is too tall and this dock is very short. The Qi charging coils is in the middle of the dock and when you put a Note 3 (with either an OEM wireless charging back plate or a QI receiver modified stock backplate) the coils are slightly located top middle which does not reach the nokia dock.The dock will work with the Samsung Galaxy SIV and other phones of similar sizes with wireless charging capabilities but do not try it with the Note 3.The sticky cups is not the best choice to mount in your car since it may peel off during seasonal changes (happened to me before). Your car needs to have a flat surface for proper mounting which my car did not have. I wish more mounting accessories were included such as air vent mounts or suction cups.I also hate how nokia wants you to organize the cable (which could be short, luckily an extension is included) and it really does not work so just leave it as is or run it through your glove compartment/arm rest if you can.While the arms have a nice grip, it's very thin so it works better on phones without cases.For the price, I cannot say it is worth it considering the cons listed above.Overall I like the dock and it's features but since I have a note 3 it serves me no purpose. So if you would like to have a wireless charging car dock and have a compatible device then I suggest this dock otherwise stick to usb cables.</td><td>List(1, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.44163608733708115, 0.5583639126629188))</td><td>5.0</td><td>Easy to apply - great protection on the screen.

When I purchased my Samsung Galaxy S4 last week, I decided that this time around I am going to purchase a flip cover and I ended up purchasing this product which is produced by Samsung. After receiving the product I was very impressed. The build and finish of the product is very solid. To install the cover, you need to open the back cover of your phone and insert the back cover that is provided by the product, which the flip cover is attached to. The back cover provided was not the same design as my Galaxy S4 Black Mist from T-Mobile, however the designs were almost identical and the quality is exactly the same. The flip cover aligns and covers the screen perfectly. Under the flip cover is microfiber, which is very gentle on the screen and holds against the screen very well. The flip cover is very slim and does not add any thickness to the phone. The appearance is gorgeous. The satin stitching is done in one direction which causes beautiful light reflection. The cover is very simple but the simplicity is wonderful.However, nothing is perfect. Even though the cover is great, I have a few issues. The flip cover is very slim and seems to be very weak in durability. If someone were to bend the cover by mistake, it would be completely destroyed and ruined. For such a high price, I expected the cover to be made of plastic or a material more durable. Also, the cover does not stay on the screen and can move around while in your pocket. This causes a lot of debris and lint to enter inside the cover which ends up being stuck on the microfiber and that can lead to small scratches on the screen of your phone. My last issue is that when you install this product, the back cover has no protection. I do understand that is part of the design however it is very prone to being scratched, which can ruin the beauty of the Galaxy S4. I did end up returning this product because I've found a similar Smart Cover from a third party on Amazon, which protects the entire phone for the same price as this one.Overall, if you are looking for a slim, sleek, and beautiful flip cover then this is a great product for you. However, if you are looking for a durable cover, then I would avoid this one. Even though it is a bit pricey for only a flip cover, it is still a good product. I hope I have helped! If you have any question or comment, please feel free to contact me!UPDATE 6/22/2013After almost two months of regular usage, the cover is still holding up very well. I just wanted to inform everyone to be aware of what company you purchase this product from. My friend purchased this product from a third party for a very low price and it turned out to be a counterfeit. If you prefer this case, I highly suggest you pay a little extra and purchase from amazon directly.</td><td>List(175, 194)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2805435317990758, 0.7194564682009241))</td><td>4.0</td><td>This case looks great on my white S4 and fits snug.

In actual use, it took me a bit to get down the call answer/hang-up/make call functions but it is like driving a stick shift- after a brief break-in, you'll be able to manage calls without thinking too hard about it.  I like the motion sensor call pick up (and call pick up when you unfold the boom). I cannot comment on dual pairing with two phones but I know others have had issues with it.  I actually like the big button but have learned how to adjust the headset on my ear without hanging up on people.Fit/Comfort: I like the behind-the-ear style as I am not fumbling with it like my motorola that I just stick in my ear.  I feel secure enough I can go walking, horsebackriding, etc. and the thing stays put.  For me this is a comfortable model, which is important to me.  I've tried several hands free sets and this is definately one of the more comfortable sets I've used.  I know other reviewers have had issues so that may be a deal-breaker for some purchasers.  Obviously one size does not fit all when it comes to ear pieces.  The positive is you can count on Amazon for an easy return if this doesn't fit you properly.Sound: Excellent sound, even in crowded places.  I guess that is attributable to the noise reduction feature.  I think it is excellent.  Aside from incoming, outgoing is great, too.  I have had any complaits from people I've called to 'speak up' or 'can you repeat that?'- even when I am outside and t is breezy or there is alot of ambient noise.  It has a boom microphone and I think the audio on this piece really is superior.Battery life: shorter than some sets but I would guess that the noise reduction and audio input draw a bit more on the battery.  It does have a long life when not being used.Volume control: the headset uses a swipe function for raising the volume.  This can be a pain but you can either get used to it or adjust from your phone.I do not wear glasses so I cannot comment on that issue- for those who do, an around-the-ear design may not be the ideal style.The voice control is 'meh' but that is not a significant feature to me.  If it is to you, you might want to try it out and see if you have success with using the voice control options.Overall, a great little headset that looks sleek and is relatively easy to use with great audio and comfort.  I definitely found it better than my motorola which was actually more expensive.  I recommend for those who can wear comfortably and deal with the brief learning curve to access the headsets functions.

I'm someone that always likes to jump on board with the latest and greatest and so I tried out the HTC One shortly after it came out. Despite my initial excitement and some positive aspects to the device and the software, I ultimately ended up returning it. I've tried to highlight the pros and cons below that led to my decision.Pros- Fantastic build quality: This is what an Android phone should be built like and it just feels fantastic to the touch. High quality materials all around - save for a few bands of plastic for the cellular and Wifi radios. Holding this in 1 hand and the SGS4 in the other makes it readily apparent which company went the extra mile to build something that feels solid in the hand. I feel like the black version in particular has a sort of soft-touch finish that makes it feel just a bit nicer to hold in the hand, and with some more grip to it as well.- Excellent screen: The color reproduction is by far the more accurate out of the recent crop of android devices on the market. I regularly use a color-calibration device on my computer monitors, so I pay particular attention to this. The unit I specifically got has a slight red-shift, but nothing that impairs the overall quality. It's definitely got more accurate color reproduction than the Samsung Galaxy S4, but some people might like the \"richer\" more saturated look that the SGS4 provides. Viewing angles are only about okay, but not a big issue for me since I'm the only one that uses this. The 1080p Resolution makes everything crisp and easy to read.- Above-average low-light performance: This phone overall does a better job than most other competitors in terms of low-light performance. I wish I could say it stands above the rest, but Nokia takes top honors in low-light and in terms of mixed lighting scenarios I still think the SGS4 is still a step up. See the cons for more information.- Good camera software: The Zoes feature is pretty cool and is a great way to create little clips or pick out the best image of the lot. It's easy to share and integrates well with existing social networks. It's one of the unique software features HTC offers, and is definitely one of the fun highlights that most people I show really enjoy playing with. I just wish it came with a dedicated camera button to make taking pictures a bit easier.- Great built-in speakers: The speakers that are built into the phone sound pretty solid if you're holding the phone in the standard portrait mode. It's great for sharing something with a friend when you're in a more public area and most phone speakers give out. Don't expect miracles from phone speakers, but as far as phone speakers go they are a step above the rest. The beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in your headphones, though it's more suitable for current pop and hip-hop music than for other genres.- Blinkfeed: Blinkfeed sort of integrates all of the news you care about into one convenient sliding panel. I tried it for a bit, and while it's convenient I also feel it was reducing my battery performance (no evidence of this), so I simply chose to ignore it. It's a great option for those of you that want to pull in information from all of your favorite sites into one area. I don't think there is a way to remove blinkfeed entirely, you can only choose to ignore it like I did. Still work trying out though!- Includes IR integration: This means the HTC can connect and control your TV, which is pretty handy when you can't find the remote. It's pretty basic in terms of the controls you get, but it works well in a pinch.- Solid wifi performance: I have a Asus AC-1750 802.11ac router and tested speeds on file transfers and media playback with the HTC One and it came through with flying colors. I was easily able to transfer a 1080p MKV movie file of around a few gigs in size in minute or 2. It's not as quick as the external 802.11ac adapters I have, but excellent for a phone.Cons- The metal build of this phone means that if it gets dropped it will definitely show some serious battle-scars, paint chipping, and dents. The SGS4, though plastic, does have durability going for it. It's a shame to feel like you have to invest in a case since it's such a good looking device, but I just don't feel safe about using this phone outside without one because it's so easy for someone to bump you accidentally and for this phone to get thrashed. The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.FOR THE BLACK VERSION: Please note that when the black version picks up small scratches and dings, which it does pretty easily I'd say, it is very noticeable because they appear a bright silver against the black finish of this phone. So buyer beware, that while the black version looks fantastic, you're risking a phone that picks up and shows scruffs very easily.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light. While this is a fine solution to capture more light and give you better low-light performance, it's not the best choice for when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light. Frankly, I just didn't think the images were that great, and the lack of zoom while working with them on your desktop becomes readily apparent - especially if you like to crop your shots after taking them like I do. I personally think Nokia's implementation of using a ridiculously large megapixel sensor and combining multiple pixels to oversample is the better solution. Take a look at the new Nokia 1020 sample images and compare to see for yourself. If I had to buy a Android phone today and wanted the best overall camera - my nod goes to the SGS4.- Average battery life: While the capacity seems decent for a phone, because of the higher resolution and larger screen I've been seeing very average to poor battery life results. I've used it mainly on my daily commute, which involves listening to Pandora to and from work, checking gmail very regularly throughout the day, and using the calendar and GPS functions frequently. I do watch a tv show during the afternoon sometimes if I'm on the go, and make about a hour or 2 worth of phone calls a day. Put simply, I've bought a external battery pack and a spare charger with me everyday that I had this phone because if I wanted to go out after work I could not trust the HTC One to make it through. Every HTC device I've tried has had middling battery life, from the HTC Sensation to the HTC One X. It seems HTC hasn't changed much here, and it's a shame because the battery is sealed in, so I'm not at all confident about battery degradation over time.- No expandable storage: The 32gb that's built into this phone, with a fair amount used up for the HTC software, just isn't enough for power users. I load on a good deal of my own music and I used to just swap out movies and tv shows onto a microSD card slot to take on the go (thanks to data caps ruining the fun of streaming them on the go). I think 32gb will be fine for most people, but not having the option to expand like the SGS4 or Sony models just puts HTC one step below.- Still some lag: This phone has some really fast internals, and does indeed run very smoothly most of the time. Unfortunately, there are still those moments of slow-down and lag that have plagued Android handsets for a while that I at least still notice. This isn't going to be a 100% smooth experience, but it's not enough to severely impact the daily use of this phone. Just wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you that care.- Poor button placement: The power button is along the top part of the phone because it's integrated with the IR blaster, meaning it can be pretty hard to reach for those with smaller hands. Moreover, HTC decided to break the Android standard and include only the back and home button with a big non-functional htc logo in the middle. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed the logo expecting to go home, and this is something my friends have done too when playing with the phone. It's just a poor design decision.Ultimately for me the most important aspects of a phone are camera performance, screen quality, and battery life. In terms of camera-performance the HTC One is just not as good as the competition, and I cannot recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel (4MP) camera when there are better options available today and coming out soon. Screen quality on this phone is probably the best you can get in nearly all regards. And the battery-life is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough for me on what I consider moderate usage. Overall, if I had to own this phone for a few years, I wouldn't feel too happy about it. While the screen quality will hold up over time, the camera performance is already behind the competition and the battery life will only get worse as the battery degrades over time. I'm glad HTC is staging a comeback and this is a great first-step, but it's still got some work to do before I can recommend their devices for long-term ownership and satisfaction.</td><td>List(5, 6)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9335079178911967, 0.06649208210880334))</td><td>4.0</td><td>It is a bummer that a phone which is praised everywhere for construction design, has quality assurance problems which led to tiny gaps between front panels and the main aluminum body! If you Google \" Gap in HTC one\" you'll see similar issues which I experienced.To me the gap between front speaker panels and the body, even tough small, but were annoying. That's why I returned it as an exchange to Galaxy S4!!I used HTC one for a few days and got really familiar with it in the real world applications. Screen is sharp and bright, but a bit small for me who already had S3 with 4.8\" screen (vs. 4.7\" of HTC one). It is fast and apps opened in a snap, 1.5GB RAM (vs 2.0 GB advertised) is good enough and 32GB of capacity is more than enough for many users. battery is OK for a full day average use. Sound and external speakers are excellent!.HTC sense UI, even though very polished and sleek, but has its own quirks; for example I don't know why the Toggle pull Down bar doesn't have any useful shortcuts anymore!In my opinion if you got one with perfect built quality and don't mind the 4.7\" screen, then go for it. If you are worried about changing battery later on, or want a bigger screen phone, go for Galaxy S4.

Works well. It's small and easy to carry.I bought a newSamsung Galaxy Nexus 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)and I knew that I would need an extra battery to make it through the day while traveling. I didn't want the extended battery like theSamsung Galaxy Nexus (i515) Extended Battery with Battery Cover. It's only 250mAh which is nothing. I also needed something portable since I fly quite a bit. This device fits the bill.Since it's LiON, it doesn't have memory like other batteries. You can start using it right away. It ships with a retractable USB to microUSB connector which is handy. Like all retractable cables, it feels a bit delicate, so be careful not to over extend the cable. The LEDs, as others have mentioned are ridiculously bright and can serve as a make-shift night light. It really is that bright. When I travel, I just bury it under a book or towel. I could do without the bright LED's though. Just a style thing. The wall wart is typical size.In use this works as you would expect. I get perhaps 4-5 charges before I need to charge it back up which takes 5-7 hours. On a recent trip, I took my phone down to 10% battery before I even got on the plane. Once airborne, I plugged the phone in to the iCruiser and watched a two hour video and played some games while the phone charged to full. About 3 hours total, perhaps? I never would have made it through my morning, let alone a day, without an extra battery. The next day, I purposely drained the phone and recharged several times during the day to exercise the battery and see how it would perform. Worked great. The power cord on the wall wart is long enough that you can use a floor strip common at trade shows and keep the battery on the table.Another big plus is that the batter pack is small. I can fit it into a shirt pocket (typical button down shirt size) charge my phone. Sure, it's looks goofy and I have to be careful of the power cable, but it works. The micro-USB connector seems a bit delicate (they all do), so I simply had to be careful. There is enough cable that I could keep the battery in my pocket and use the phone.One thing to note. When I first got the iCruiser, I used an existing USB cable from my OG Droid. It didn't work. The Galaxy Nexus never charged and in fact, drained while I was using it. I almost returned the iCruiser because I thought it was defective. I read the pamphlet that came with it and thought I'd try once more with the supplied USB cable. Sure enough, my phone charged like a champ even while in use. The point? The Motorola USB cable is either defective and never noticed since I use it with a wall wart OR Motorola did something special to the cable. If you aren't getting good charge times, try a different USB cable.I nicked one star for the simple reason that the iCruiser doesn't have an auto shut-off and I expected one. I left the phone to charge overnight with the iCruiser not plugged into the wall. I woke up with a charged phone and a dead battery. I honestly don't know if having a auto shut-off when full feature is even possible, so if someone can clarify that it is not, I will likely add the star back in (can't nick a star due to my expectations if the product works as it should).</td><td>List(2, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9463987234925775, 0.0536012765074226))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I'm going to keep this review short and simple.  I switched over to the HTC EVO but returned it because it felt just a bit too big in my hand.  The other fact was it did not have SWYPE nor did it have a real keyboard.  I thought I would get used to having a virtual keyboard but I could not get used to it.However the Samsung Epic 4G is a great phone since it has SWYPE which works surprisingly well as well as a slide out keyboard. There have been some complaints about how the keys are not offset and I do find it a bit harder to type on it having been used to the Blackberry 9700 which was my previous phone.The phone is very responsive, battery life is not that great, you have to definitely charge it after 8-10 hours of moderate use.  I usually have 4G and GPS turned off (I don't have 4G in Sacramento) or that would use up the battery faster.I was able to connect to my Outlook email at work without any problems and it pushes the email to your Android just like the Blackberry does and it also syncs your Outlook Calender.Pinch to zoom works within Email and on Web pages and its very responsive.The killer feature is the support of DLNA, so I can view my video, audio and picture files on my PC over WI-FI on my Samsung Epic and it works seamlessly.  I can also stream video, audio and pictures from the Epic to my PC or my LG DLNA enabled Blue Ray player so that I can view it on my TV.Google Voice integration seems to be better than on the Blackberry.  Overall this phone is very intuitive to use, I had a bit more trouble with the HTC EVO.I also was able to install YouMail from the Android app store and set up conditional call forwarding (see the Youmail website on instructions since Sprint is slightly different).  While Visual Voicemail is available with Sprint, I prefer YouMail.Overall I have to say I am very pleased with this phone and would definitely recommend it.Having used Swype on this phone and finding it so easy to use, I wonder if I needed the keyboard after all.  I still wanted it as a crutch until I can let go.  This phone runs Android 2.1If you are a Blackberry user and are hesitant to switch, then I can honestly say that coming to this phone from a Blackberry 9700 it took a couple of days to get used to it, but I was able to do everything on this phone and much more.  Also due to RIM not releasing Blackberry OS 6 to existing Blackberry 9700 customers until next year even though its available for their new phone, I felt it was time to make the switch.The only app that I miss that is only available on the Blackberry is VIIGO, but I use Newsrob instead which seems adequate though not as nice as VIIGO.Update: 9/13/2010I got to use the Navigation feature and it works great.  I was able to say the name of the place I wanted to go and it began navigation right away.  The default voice sounds a bit funny and sometimes difficult to understand since the street names don't often get pronounced correctly.  I especially like the Satellite view mode since I can actually see the buildings, and I like how it switches to Street view when you are close to your destination.</td><td>List(5, 6)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7630606937554281, 0.2369393062445719))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I can't believe I almost returned this case without giving it a second chance.The case is good much better than the one I got from Best Buy and its price is much cheaper.The bottom part can be removed whenever docking the phone.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7384866093381381, 0.26151339066186174))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I did emailed u when I got my order of Otterbox Case for iPhone 4g REd/black but front was spot wont remove I like to have other one no pay I will return other but I perfer get replace first because I easily drop iphone I dont want break or crack.thanks,emiestringer</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7848427935114048, 0.21515720648859524))</td><td>4.0</td><td>Case works great.

Coming from a long line of Nokia products, I was fully prepared for some of the typical Nokia glitches/characteristics.  The N8 has a phenomenal camera, which I used extensively.  However, after sampling an Android OS smartphone, I felt a bit cheated (read: jealous) that such as powerful, high quality device like the N8 didn't have certain applications or support from its software developers.  Nokia's OVI store has come a long way from my previous E50 and E71, but at the end of the day, I felt like something was missing.  Most touch screen phones are usually easy to operate, but this one required far more (and almost unnecessary) key strokes and steps to accomplish every task, that it became exhausting to do anything.  Previous Symbian powered devices run circles around it with their old school hardware keys.  I did not experience any of the shut downs or problems may others did.  Conversely, this had so many great Nokia features and hardware I hated to return it because I'm such a Nokia fan...but with the recent withdrawal of Nokia from the US market I felt abandoned as a long term customer.Likes: excellent camera, alarm clock that works even if you power the phone off, built in OVI maps (not reliant upon the buggy network carrier), battery life, screen resolution and build quality.Dislikes: cost, lack of popular applications available for download, buggy processor at times, and extremely difficult data input method.If the E7 would have the N8's camera, or the N8 the E7's keyboard I suspect it would've been easier to live with.</td><td>List(4, 5)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9998457310118104, 1.5426898818954652E-4))</td><td>4.0</td><td>The N8 is my second Nokia phone, after the E71. Granted, I'm finding it challenging to move from the E71's QWERTY keyboard to the virtual keyboard on the N8. But, the challenges don't end there. Let me back up and say, first off, both that I really wanted to love the N8 and also that its hardware gives a lot to be loved.The phone feels great in the hand. The camera is all you've probably heard about, and more (plus, third party developers are now releasing apps that really unleash the camera's capabilities to the amateur photographer). Battery life is pretty good - not exceptional, but really good for a smart phone. I use this phone a lot and only occasionally have I had to put it on a USB or car charger, in the late afternoon. 3.5MM headphone jack is welcome. MicroSDHC slot puts the N8 ahead of the E7, in my opinion. Despite the modest clock speed of its CPU, I rarely experience sluggish behavior from this phone.Personally, I think Microsoft made a good move, in their alliance with Nokia; this phone proves Nokia's hardware is among the top of smart phones available today. The WindowsPhone OS can only go up, whereas I've about given up hope that Nokia's software development will ever improve. While Symbian^3 is a significant improvement over particularly the touchscreen capabilities of its Symbian predecessors, Nokia is not breaking any land-speed records with it's OS development cycle. Integration with PC-and cloud-based calendar, contacts, tasks, and other apps is really bad. Nokia's decision to prohibit the newest versions of Nokia PC Suite from syncing with the N8 - forcing N8 users to rely upon the awful and fatally buggy Nokia Ovi Suite - frankly illustrates some arrogant disregard Nokia holds for its customer base. Nokia Ovi Suite is but one reason why Nokia is failing in the market for higher-end phones. Perhaps Microsoft can help shore up Nokia's fortunes in this area; it's hard to imagine the alliance with Microsoft making the software situation with Nokia much worse.Both the portrait and landscape keyboards are finicky; even Swype (while a big improvement over the delivered landscape keyboard) lags behind Android and iOS keyboards. Third party developers, such as mobileways.de, which develop the excellent Twitter app, \"Gravity,\" have proven keyboard design can be much better, on Symbian (in fact, Gravity proves there's much that can be done with the entire Symbian UI, if Nokia only applied itself).Nokia continues to only partially implement significant enhancements - it allows users to designate an alternate browser, as the default, then never calls the default browser; only using its lackluster native browser (although update PR2.0, expected in March or April, 2011, is expected to produce an improved browser). Particularly if Opera Mobile adds pinch-to-zoom, I expect even Nokia's updated browser will find itself not listed as most user's default web browsers. Symbian^3 allows for multiple calendars to be created, but there's no way to accept appointments received as iCal files attached to emails into one specific calendar; they only go to the default and have to be manually moved to another calendar, if desired. Symbian still has no notion of \"categories\" for appointments, tasks, contacts, or as a file attribute (a feature the Palm OS had, more than a decade ago). Don't expect to sync categories from Outlook, for example, to your Nokia phone. The calendar on the N8 is the worst calendar I've ever seen on a smart phone. No agenda view; no way to exclude tasks from what few views offered; an awful month-at-a-glance view. . . the calendar on the N8 is a real step backwards, even when compared to the old E71. Here again is an example where the WindowsPhone OS can only produce better functionality. It is astonishing to me that, even now, no third party developer has released a calendar app that beats the awful calendar shipped on the N8.As of this writing, there is no ereader app available for commercial ebook formats such as the Kindle, eReader.com, MobiPocket, or Nook. This is but one example of the considerable disregard of the Symbian^3 OS held by the commercial developer marketplace. I fear this is one area where the Microsoft alliance will pose a challenge; will developers continue to work with Symbian, even after the phone is updated to Symbian^4, with the possibility the WP OS will spell the future for high-end Nokia phones?Nokia continues efforts at developing innovative new apps, through its Beta Labs, but it is not rolling out needed updates to basic products such as Nokia Ovi Suite, fast enough.There are some things Symbian^3 does do very well. It's multitasking capabilities and memory management are head-and-shoulders above other mobile OS', in my opinion. While Nokia has implemented copy-and-paste relatively poorly, in the N8, that feature and many others are available. Ovi Maps is one standout application that ships with the phone (and its turn-by-turn navigation is a real value-added feature to this phone). The music app isn't half bad (but, Nokia, why do you make it possible for me to edit photos and video directly on the phone, but make it impossible to edit MP3 tags?) and the video playback is very good, whether on the phone or using its HDMI output.I could go on, but I should probably instead get to the bottom line: Do I recommend this phone? Yes and No. If you are already familiar with Symbian - the good and the bad - then you'll probably find a lot to like, in the N8. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in tinkering with your phone, you might want to seriously consider the iPhone, one of the many Android phones or (for those of you looking for a business-oriented phone) a Blackberry. Every week or two, I debate about whether I'm going to sell my N8 and return to the trusty E71; if you go with the N8, you need to do so after looking at both the good and the bad. And maybe PR2.0 and the other promised updates in 2011 actually will improve the prospects for this Symbian device. At least, that is, until Nokia's phones sporting the WindowsPhone - Nokia style - start to hit the street.</td><td>List(4, 5)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.24442489446864096, 0.755575105531359))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I bought the Nokia N8 for my mom for Christmas because it had all the things she wanted (touch screen phone, smart phone, mp3 player, and to combine devices such as her excellent camera). Alas, she didn't want it (likes her simple flip better, easier to hold, and she doesn't like touch screen for a phone, just for an mp3 player)But ....I DIG it. It is smaller than the E7, which is a beast in comparison. Camera is amazing, flash blinding.Other awesome factors:! HDMI out! USB on the goFM transmitter - so simple, but so so convenientstorage &lt;- 16gb built in + 32gb on microsd = 48gb (plus usb)Data access is very controllable. Maps can update via sms (or network, or simple unassisted GPS). You can set priority of data access to favor wifi, or whatever priority for many access points (wifi, 3g, network, etc). Manage data. Cool. I say, get this phone, and go for a cheap GSM plan.Notes:1. came with Symbian^3, but not Anna. Anna makes the difference. If Anna hadn't updated, I would definitely have returned it. Lusting for Belle.2. camera protector - it ships with a camera protector for shipping. Remove this thing or your photos will be super hazy.Get these apps:Nokia apps: Situations, Panorama, PlayTo, Here and Now, Big Screen, Reader (but, don't subscribe to too much it will drive you crazy if a widget), Map, Drive, Places (pretty cool)Noka beta apps: Live View (frikkin awesome)3rd party, best: Fring (forward facing camera, google voice integration, etc, second favorite 3rd party), Opera Mini or Mobile (favorite 3rd party app), Wordpress3rd party, non-Ovi: Books (from Meego project, not sure who the developer is)It's kind of slippery. I think anyone who gets it will have to get some kind of protector case.Drat:1) I haven't found a way to turn on the camera flash as a flashlight like my E7 (and pretty much all my other old Nokes handsets would) will do (hold screen lock for like 5 sec till it comes on/off)2) no Kindle app3) no Netflix of Hulu4) no Meego :( why Nokia why? so sad (tho Anna is good)BELLE UPDATE;Belle is very pretty. It seems to improve performance (speed). Books (which I previously got from Meego site) now appears in the updated Nokia Store. Nokia Live View (beta app) is now Nokia City Scape.UPDATE (2012-0610):Still love the phone after 6 mo.Why? Several reasons.Amazing camera.Lots of photo & music/sound editing capability onboard (with each Symbian version), gps voice navigation the same quality as a stand alone unit (this alone makes it worth the purchase), FM extras (radio and radio out). Also, the autocorrect/predictive text is better than my ipod touch, by several orders of magnitude, which really surprises me. Also like the large onboard and very large expandable memory. And HDMI out. And built in backup options.Perpetual annoyances: not Meego (so sad so sad), no Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video, no Kindle app. There are ways to Get Around each of these annoyances, but, well, if it had Meego there would be no need. Hoping Nokia/Accenture merges Meego with the goodies of the other open source platforms (WebOS & Meego/Tizen) and resurrects in house OS. But not holding my breath on that one. Also, strangely, the phone likes to spontaneously reboot; is this due to my carrier (TMo)? full phone memory? What's that about? I have the feeling it may be carrier related, but again, no bets there.I've got a family plan, with an ancient data plan which is very cheap. And in this case, there are very few options out there with better value (than using this unlocked user-controlled phone).</td><td>List(7, 8)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.15365648266411397, 0.8463435173358861))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Had this phone for over 3 weeks but just had to return it. Let me tell you this phone has a great quality build and great spec's. The overall hardware is incomparable and really stands out in comparison to that of the competition. The 12 megapixel camera takes outstanding pictures and can easily replace a \"point and shoot\" camera.. Honestly the phone is an honest good buy but the Symbian OS ruines the whole user experience.I have been an avid Nokia user since the release of the Nokia N95. From there on I have owned the N82, N86 and jumped to the N900 last year. After being spoiled using the Maemo OS found in the N900 I honestly hoped that the Symbian's OS update would catch up and even exceed Maemo which has now evolved into MeeGo thanks to it's partnership with Intel. Sadly Symbian stays way behind and I found myself wanting to throw the phone across the room at times due to the various frustrations it caused.Constant freezing, long wait time, and constant clicking from one thing to another just to get a task done. I love you Nokia but Android and Apple's iOs have left you behind. I'm only hoping that Nokia's next flagship phone has MeeGo OS as it's software platform and maybe I'll jump back and be the happy customer I once was when owning a Nokia device.Overall if your looking to own a phone with excellent call quality, outstanding hardware/build and looking to replace your \"point and shoot\" camera with a phone then go ahead and make your purchase. But if your out looking for a great overall Smartphone then I recommend you look away from anything running Symbian.</td><td>List(15, 16)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9961370824410706, 0.0038629175589295064))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I bought this phone for use by a visually impaired person.

But I knew this, and just wanted a reliable, basic phone for someone who can't see well.It performed its basic function for about seven months.  Then its ability to pick up signals became very unreliable--no service anywhere, then suddenly service, then no service.  Very frustrating, and ultimately not usable.  Then I discovered the company has no meaningful customer service--no phone number (the one they provide connects to a fax), a 30-day return policy to the the vendor who sold it--typically some fly-by-night operation you'll never get ahold of.

The simplistic approach is what really works. I have just a back case on my phone and it fit perfectly. It is easy to put the phone in and take it out and there is not a worry that it will come out.Well done.Update: I just cannot say enough good things about this band. I guess I am just so used to having an armband be uncomfortable or having to strap it so tight so it won't slip. Yes, you do have to be gentle with the holder but that is common sense.

The sound is flat, lifeless and boomy (is that a word?).  The earbuds that I received free on a flight that probably cost the airline less than 50 cents sounded a whole lot better than these and I can't understand why Jabra couldn't have found a way to give us headphones with decent sound quality.  While I suppose you can use your own headphones, I think it's unacceptable that Jabra provided such lo-fi earphones with the unit.I hate the way the unit clips onto your shirt or whatever.  It's tough to open it,  as it's not spring-loaded, and if you pull it open more than 4mm, then you'll damage the unit because it won't return to it's original position.  If you are wearing a T-shirt without a chest pocket, you'll have a tough time figuring out how to secure the device to your shirt. There must have been a better way to design this thing.I'm also not crazy about all of the wires.  Sure, it's Bluetooth, but you have to plug wired earphones into the transmitter/receiver unit.  It's still easy to pull the earphones out of your ears by bumping the wires by accident, as I did a number of times.  Also, if the clip comes loose, it will likely yank the poorly-fitting earbuds from your ears, which is annoying.I don't understand why the charger has a 12\" cord.  What's the point in that?  I wanted to use a power strip to charge the unit but because the cord is so short, I had to leave the unit sitting on the floor while charging rather than on the table.  I don't get it.So what's to like?  Well, it pairs easily.  It works as advertised.  It's relatively small and light, even if I'm not thrilled with the form factor.  The microphone's sound quality seems decent.I started off giving the unit 3 stars, but after further examination I downgraded it to 2 because I'm simply not thrilled with these headphones.  I think that Jabra could have done a much better job with this unit.</td><td>List(4, 6)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.941766918627077, 0.058233081372923))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I researched well before purchasing this HS.

It doesn't feel like cheap plastic, it IS cheap plastic, but they are extremely comfortable because of the padding, and I wear glasses, so you can imagine how it would be an issue, and it isn't.As for the distance, well, I've had my share of BT headsets, and none comes even close to the reach of this one. In a 400MT2 office, I can move all around and it will never skip. Now, what strikes me as weird is that, with such a long reach, when I'm outside, Phone in back pocket and listening to music, if I look right, all is good, but if I move my head slightly to the left, then it skips a bit. I've still to find out the reason for this weird behavior, but this is only outside and in a widely populated commercial are, could be some kind of interference.One of the paddings was not glued correctly, as soon as I opened the packaging I saw the there was that open spot, so I'm crazy glueing that today, not worth going through the return and get a new one hassle for something like that and for that price.Amazing value for the price, no doubt about it.I'm altogether happy with this purchase</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9748122821084365, 0.02518771789156345))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I bought this headset primarily for use with a laptop running Windows 7.  I was tired of bulky cords tying me down to an otherwise very mobile computer.  The quick version is this: I do not recommend this product.DESIGN / QUALITY+++ The headset seems sturdy, and comes with a nice, and fairly compact semi-rigid carrying case.  Materials were good.+++ Device was inexpensive, definitely a plus.--- The set is very uncomfortable.  It pinches the tops of the ears tight.  I've had other headphones with this design that were much more comfortable.--- The length of the behind-the-head portion of the set can't be adjusted.  If you're sitting down (for example, using this with a phone in a car) you'll find yourself jutting your head forward because the back of this headset hits the seat.  Very uncomfortable.RECEPTION / TECHNICAL+++ The bluetooth signal was good, and picked up immediately by my computer.  I experienced no interruptions or interference.--- This headset does not work with windows 7 out of the box.  The manual has setup instructions for windows, but I was confused that there were steps I wasn't seeing when I followed along.  It turns out that right in the middle of the instructions, in small print, you are directed to the manufacturer's website to purchase additional accessories (dongles) which are required to pair this device with a laptop, even if your computer has built in bluetooth.--- 3rd party bluetooth software will recognize this device as a generic headset and will pair with it, but most cost money (most are more than the headset itself).+++ When listening to music (phone, computer, etc) the sound quality is stereo and excellent.  Quite impressed for such a small, inexpensive device.+++ People commented that the mic sounded loud and clear.--- When using this as a full headset(talking to other people with it) the sound becomes mono and the quality drops very noticeably.  I'm not an audiophile, but this sound was jarringly bad,.  It was enough to distract me from what I was hearing.  I tried numerous workarounds but could not get high quality sound while using the mic.In conclusion, I'm returning this headset because it won't work for my laptop, the main reason I purchased it.  That the instructions walk you halfway through setup before telling you to buy additional accessories and/or software is very annoying, almost deceptive.  Even for a phone or other bluetooth device I would not recommend this product.  The headphones are very uncomfortable, much tighter on the ears than similar designs that I've owned.  The headband sticks out from the back of your head significantly, and the whole setup can get knocked off your ears easily, despite how tight it clamps.</td><td>List(8, 10)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9453935600552673, 0.05460643994473266))</td><td>2.0</td><td>Usually a hybrid is a combination of good or proven features melded into one product. I have had this case for a week and still can't determine what those features might be. After using Body Glove cases for years, their QC has declined and my only Otter Box (Defender for iPhone) was superb.What this case does well, it does really well but what it lacks is so sorely lacking that it makes one wonder what the designers were thinking. For example, the obvious point is protection. The two areas least needing the bulk of protection are the most attended to by this case.The back and the areas around the bottom front are protected by thick silicone with the back receiving both the best of the silicone and the hard shell. The areas most fragile in the Droid's design, the screen and speaker areas are virtually unprotected.While I received a case that the port covers fit perfectly on, the narrow lip around the screen proper puckers up 1/16th to almost 1/8th of an inch from contacting the surface. It's nice to have the ports covered but there is enough room for dirt, liquid or debris to enter from the screen area to negate any protection.The choice of the plastic shell areas of coverage are dubious as well. As mentioned, the back gets the lions share with half coverage of the bottom corners and the sides. The back does overlap the top but stops before getting near the fragile speaker and its accent trim area.I really wanted to like this case as my cell phone is my life-line living alone so protecting it is critical to me. The lack of coverage of the most vulnerable areas of the Droid makes this a \"why bother\" item. I have never returned an item to Amazon but with it boasting all the features one would expect in a 3 dollar case, I will eat the shipping and return this $26.50 (that includes shipping) item for another Body Glove.The Body Glove makes no pretense of being anything other than a hard shell but despite QC issues, it remains a valid case for it's 10 dollar price range while this unit isn't acceptable by any Otter Box standards I have ever seen.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.29794947192118776, 0.7020505280788123))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Edit - this was a great headset - for about 6 weeks, which is 2 weeks afetr Amazon's return period.

Pairing was cake and my Droid 2 was synced in 60 seconds.  The ear piece folds for even more compact storage and so I turned the device off with thew simple switch on top as I packed for the trip.  I finally got a chance to try on and adjust the unit at the airport.  The fit is easy and very light.  Honestly I could not believe how light, its larger than my Icon but feels smaller when worn.  To be clear this is the most comfortable bluetooth I have even owned.  I can wear and talk for hours with out a sore ear.  The talk time is about 4 1/2 hours for me and recharge ranges from 45 min to 1 1/2 hours. I used this Oasis almost exclusively on my trip and found it to be my go to headset when I returned home.So pros: awesome talk time, recharge time is short, and most important very very comfortable.Cons: I have lost three of the rubber ear seals, I have a habit of folding the unit to put it in my pocket I seem to lose them in the journey in and out of my pocket.  I also have to say that the noise reduction is NOT as good as my Icon.  So I find myself swaping between the Icon and  the Oasis depending on the noise level I encounter. (Why not just stick with the Icon?...well this Oasis is more comfortable for all day wear.)So there you have it a great unit with a few minor drawbacks but all an all an excellent headset.

I thought maybe this is a new concept and takes time so the one nearest to fitting, I used that for a couple of days after which I realised they are painful and must be returned besides they dont stick for long. My despair was that the website refused to accept it back saying the product works exactly like its supposed to work and they cant do anything about that. They said the fact that it doesnt feel comfy for me - is not their concern because the product is designed to be like that but they cant accept it because they cant resell it and because I cant find anything wrong with it and its working as designed. This is the first time I have been duped by a retailer online and since then I have stopped depending on them for things like refunds and warranties. Somewhere I am still under agony...

I did, however, want to confirm that the 903+ is NOT moisture-resistant, and will consequently fail.  Just one day after my return window, my 903+ started acting up during a workout.  I was listening to music from my phone through its bluetooth connection, when the 903 started beeping as if I were pressing any of its function buttons (except I wasn't).  Then, my phone's bluetooth voice dialer application started opening and closing, at times dialing what it THOUGHT it was hearing through the 903.  Some of the 903's buttons stopped responding to my inputs, and eventually, they all did.  Then the music stopped.When I got back to my room, I examined the headset, shaking it a bit to see if any sweat had gotten in them.  It had, and started dripping out of nearly every joint and crevice on the device.  I shook as much of it out as I could, and after letting them dry out overnight, most of the buttons work again, and I can hear music again.  However, the \"phone call\" button still doesn't work, and the left ear speaker sounds blown out and distorted.  Needless to say, my only recourse at this point is to return them to Plantronics for warranty work.Bottom line: the 903+ sounds and works great when it's bone dry, but if you plan to use them for any sort of workout where you might get sweaty, it's just a matter of time before you have issues. Had I known they were so easily susceptible to moisture intrusion, I would have saved my money and stuck with my wired set.</td><td>List(88, 101)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6551737985188288, 0.34482620148117105))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I wanted to return it, but got stuck with it.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9886722884033441, 0.01132771159665595))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I'm a former iPhone 3g user,* and a complete Android novice, so I thought I'd just give some of my impressions for the novices/newbies/potential switchers. Read the other reviews for more technical assessments. This phone is astoundingly fast and stable compared to my older iPhone. Apps are more stable, and phone calls are dropped less frequently with T-Mobile for some reason. The touch screen is a bit less sensitive than the iPhone, but once you are used to it, it's fine. One large difference for me is that when you move to Android, you see how tightly controlled the iPhone universe is. That's not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you don't want to play around with the device, but compared to the openness of the Android platform it suddenly felt restrictive and confining. And as a user of many Google services, I like the tight integration.Am I glad I switched? Absolutely. I had no particular quarrel with AT&T;'s signal and service, but the device itself was simply going kablooie too frequently (incidentally, my most recent iPhone was a swap for a refurb at the Apple store, as my first iPhone crashed and was unrepairable). For me, areas where the G2 soundly beats at least the older iPhones are: multiple keyboards, fewer app crashes, ability to modify your phone, speed and general array of useful features that you can customize. I can't see returning to an iPhone. As for the slider keyboard, maybe it's just me, but I don't see how the keyboard would slide out on its own as mine requires pushing through some stiffness.And no I'm not an Android fanboi, at least not yet. The downsides of the phone include a lack of good accessories, fast battery drain (even after killing apps), and lousy speaker, and at least so far, the limited number of apps compared to the Apple closed universe.*Yes, I know the 3gs and the 4 are faster, but that's not relevant here, as these are the phones that I am familiar with. Even accounting for the age of the 3g iPhone, the G2 is so much faster that the difference cannot be explained only by the age of my 3g. I'm talking here about processing speed, not network speed.</td><td>List(2, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.953966469593688, 0.046033530406311994))</td><td>2.0</td><td>In my experience, the HTC Evo 4G eats batteries all day long so I purchased two of these kits.  The phone is much larger with the extended life battery installed, but they did provide me with enough power to get through days at trade shows/conferences without searching for a power outlet.  Occasionally, I would notice the phone getting hot during charge cycles so I would swap out the battery for the other and the temp would return to normal.  I didn't notice any other issues for 9-10 months, but eventually they appeared to expand.  It was never enough to pop the cover off the phone, but they were noticeably bowed out on the flat sides (not the edges).

Take a minute and look and think about the item. This is a solar charger, you cannot expect an electrical charge out of it like you would right out of your wall socket. This item is $25 bucks, and I know that if you were to go into a Radio Shack to purchase this very same item it would run you, \"oh I would say anywhere from $59 -$89 bucks\". Yes the battery indicator does not indicate a green light for rechargeable batteries, so you do need a voltmeter, and I have seen voltmeters at the dollar store that work well or on this site for a buck or two. Of course your batteries will charge without a voltmeter, it's just so you will know when the batteries are fully charged. Just use common sense depending on the weather. This charger so far, works great, as long as you have patients and a little understanding for the still in process movement of solar energy. This charger charges four AA within a charge, or two AAA batteries within one charge, one charge can take up to 1 to 2 or 4 days, this all depends on your location, weather, and rechargeable batteries you are using. This device fully charged my HTC Touch just fine off of two AA batteries; you can charge a device with either 4 AA batteries in the charger which is nice! Or you can charge a device with 2 AA batteries in the charger which works fine as well; you can also charge a device with regular none chargeable batteries (single use batteries)! That is a big plus for those who travel a lot. Those who want the option of being able to charge their digital cameras, phones, or whatever device it may be that can handle the correct charge from this charger. The USB output is DC 5.0---350mA and the charging current is 200mA for 2 batteries and 100mA for 4 batteries. My unit did come in a package that was sealed, and yes it has a shiny finish, but there are some small scratches that make it look like it was used before hand (which I doubt, I think it's just the best finish they can come up with).  So far the unit is working good, I recommend it for either travel, or emergencies, because you can use regular none rechargeable batteries to charge up your devices successfully, make sure you test it out before leaving town, and yes you can use rechargeable batteries, just recognize the time it may take to charge it. The other reason why I recommend this device is for emergencies, or even if SHTF for those who know what I am talking about :) it will work great for flash lights and portable games for your kids. Oh I almost forgot, the other poster was right, the durability is not solid, but not that weak either (meaning it won't break as long as you don't throw it against a wall or drop it 50 times like some do with their phones. I will repost on here with updates, I plan on testing out outdoor solar light rechargeable batteries in this charger, and please excuse my grammar; I am posting this as a favor to you, and hope it helped a little.</td><td>List(16, 19)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8691157905459607, 0.13088420945403934))</td><td>2.0</td><td>it was not made for my phone, I returned it and only got one dollar 5 cents back because of the return shipping. it was my error.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6600866220602858, 0.3399133779397142))</td><td>3.0</td><td>i can't believe no one has stated this in their review yet, but with this unit you cannot listen to a voicemail (voice mail) on the landline phone that this devices connects your cell phone to.  you can make outgoing and take incoming calls, but you will always need your cell phone nearby to dial into your voicemail and check messages.  for this reason alone i find that the advertising slogan stating that this unit is great for small businesses to be a pretty big stretch.  in fact i can't even believe that cobra doesn't advertise this shortcoming on their own website.other than that, the device works as stated and is significantly cheaper than the XLink version that does the same.  for me i'll probably wind up returning as i really wanted a landline telephone to replace the need for using the cell phone at all completely (unless i leave the house and take the cell phone with me).  having to use both phones at home--depending on whether i'm making a call or checking a voicemail--quite honestly just makes things more complicated than just using a cell phone all on its own.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.49109695902312295, 0.5089030409768771))</td><td>4.0</td><td>If you get poor cell reception in most of your home, but can find some \"good\" spots, you may need something like this.

I loved my T505.  It sounded great on internal speaker or on FM radio. Either the Roadster or the Cruiser sound good on internal speaker with the edge going to Roadster for sound quality, appearance and features.I had high hopes for the Jabra Cruiser based on the mostly positive reviews.  It sounds okay if you don't need FM radio connectivity.  If you do need FM, go for the Motorola T505.  The Cruiser is a major disappointment.  It sounds decent on internal speaker but gets boomy and distorted at full volume.  It's also a large unit and lacks the features that the Motorola Roadster has.  If I didn't care about FM I would have stuck with the Roadster.I spent time on the phone with both Jabra tech support and Motorola tech support trying to fix the FM issues with both.  No luck with either.  I ended up returning 2 Roadsters (Motorola tech support suggested it might be a defective unit - and I couldn't believe that the FM could be worse on a later model than the T505) I ended up returning the Cruiser as well due to lousy FM performance.Today my new Motorola T505 arrived and it works great! FM sound quality is fantastic.  The 505 is not quite as loud on internal speaker as the loudest settings on either the Cruiser or the Roadster but it is more than adequate.  Plus the build quality just feels sturdier with the 505 unlike the Jabra Cruiser which feels cheap.  The Jabra sounds cheap too on the loudest settings where the internal speaker distorts badly.</td><td>List(39, 45)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9431656127948631, 0.056834387205136894))</td><td>1.0</td><td>i dont often return a 20 dollar item, but this piece of junk makes me so mad i wont just throw it away. back cover wont stay attached. the rubber that is supposed to insert into the antenna hole keeps popping out. same for the usb plug.  better off buying a 7 dollar cover that stays attached vs this piece of junk. waste of time, money, and aggravation.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7891807431071027, 0.21081925689289724))</td><td>2.0</td><td>This is a good product, but I didn't like that you need to put a lot of effort to attach the phone after the Mount is installed in the car.

Well I just want to say it has an awesome sound!!! The frequency range is 17-22kHz which is pretty darn good! It did take a little while to figure out how to change the ear gels, and find the right one that fit my ear, and also to get adept at fitting it in. But the instructions were pretty good... it just takes a couple practices to get it right. I like that they don't go all the way into my ear canal.  The gels hold them securely by fitting to your ear cartilage, so they won't fall out. I tested this by running, and they stayed put! They also are sweatproof/waterproof, which is essential for a runner.I had someone call my phone while playing music. The Droid X paused the music and sent the ringtone and call through to the Jabra. The caller said that the mic sounded great. It has noise reduction (which Jabra is one of the best at accomplishing!), and the sound on both ends of the call was very clear! The mic is located on the wire close to your mouth, which really helps. I was really worried when I ordered these that they would not work well w/ the Motorola Droid X. But all the buttons work perfectly as they should. The volume slider works, and on the mic you just squeeze/click it to answer a call or mute the call, or to change songs.  To end a call you just hold the button longer on the mic. Very easy to operate!  I also ordered a pair of Motorola headphones, but am thinking of returning them (without ever even opening them) because I just love these Jabra ones!!! If you can find the perfect fitting gel out of the 3 sets they give you (and can position it to hold in your ear), I say go for these!

So far so good.  I have to say I was a bit worried about installation after reading some of the reviews.  Some reviews state that installation can be tricky and taking the phone mount on and off can be hard.  I had no problems with installation.  I even had to remove it to adjust the position and I had no problems removing it.  There is a tension knob that you can turn to adjust the device if your phone is a bit heavy, as mine seemed to be, and make it stand straigh.  Yes, you need to be careful as with anything.  You can't just snatch it off or push it on too hard or it will break.  The arms that attach to your vent are thin and plastic with metal springs to adjust to the width of your vents.  It also came with extra springs and a number to call to activate a warranty.All in all it is very sturdy, so far.  It works well with my phone which is an HTC EVO Shift which has a case on it.  It Mounts nicely in my car which is a Kia Soul.  My only issue is when I tried to attach my charger to my phone and have it in the mount it didn't fit right with the little legs out.  The side arms used to hold the phone are long so when you have the legs extended out for additional support there is just a small open space.  I had to fold the legs back, adjust my phone so that it was pushed down slightly to clear the arm and allow my charger to be there. That was a small thing though.  I am keeping the box it came in because as one of the other reviewer stated, in order to return it you need to have the original packing.  I don't anticipate having to return it but you never know.  I would recommend this phone mount to anyone looking for one.  I may even purchase another for my husband.May 2013ok so had this for almost a year and out broke on me about February.  the pieces that clip on to your vent broke and I  am not one to put it on and take it off.

Since I've heard so much good things about Google operating system I wanted to buy another phone and try it out. I first bought Motorola XT720 with Android 2.1 but realized that the SD memory with over 7gb couldn't be used when downloading apps from Google market!? So I ran out of memory after using up only few thousand megabytes of the phone memory.  There were other flaws such as not being able to create Yahoo email accounts for quick viewing of all the email accounts with out loging in and loging out with each email. Whereas iPhone you can have Gmails and Yahoo mails accounts and I have over 15 email accounts in which you can see it all at once.  I returned the Motorola and got my Mytouch 4g just two days ago and so far I'm loving it!  I say so far because who knows what will pop up after playing with it for awhile like I did with the Motorola.  Anyway, I checked the user reviews for this phone prior to purchasing and that the consensus was that it is a good phone but has couple of complaints such as speaker volume.  Sure enough, after trying it out, the speaker is really poor compared to the Motorola I had. The Motorola had dual speakers and this Mytouch only has one so when you're in a semi-loud environment you really can't hear too well even the volume is up all the way. Another complaint was the face to face video calling but I haven't used it yet and I'm not that much concern about it since not too many people have that capability on their phones so I don't need that feature at this time.  Otherwise, everthing else seems to work just fine.  I love the camera with flash and the video recording comes with flash light so you can record in the dark! I will continue to update if I see anything else I need to mention as I get used to using this phone more.Edit: December 13th, 2010I've been using this phone now for little less than a month and I'm changing my opinion from loving it to just liking it.  The things I really like about this phone so far are that what I mentioned before, camera and apps from Google.  Also, this phone does allow you to create more than one email accounts from both Yahoo and Gmails.  So I'm able to see it all at once since I have over 15 email accounts. It is, however, not as good as my iPhone 3G.  It seems to be much slower in retrieveing all the emails compared to my iphone and it's not clear cut looking either.  Ok here's the one MAJOR reason that I had to drop the star rating from 4 to 3 stars on this phone, and that is the battery life is ridiculously WEAK!  I thought my iPhone 3g was weak but it still isn't that bad compared to Mytouch 4G!  It is a pet-peeve of mine with a weak battery life on any phones, the CNET review says 4 to 5 hours of talking time but I really didn't even come close to using it that much.  I tried using the battery saver apps such as killer apps and juice saver apps but none helped at all!  I barely use it for no more than an hour of talking then did some internet surfing for couple of hours and my battery had drained more than 40%???  This is after fully charged!  So now I have to charge this phone about twice a day if not more!  I don't know if it's the battery that might be defected or not but it's a brand new phone and battery and I'm not about to go and spend another $40 for a new battery to see if it's defected or not.  Another flaw detection is that when I am sending some old photos from my laptop to my emails so that I could downloaded to this phone's gallery but it wouldn't do it???!!! I never thought this would be an issue?  This phone doesn't have a selection of which to download into the gallery format!  So the photos are just stuck there in the format under the email I sent and if I need to view it, I have to open that email and view it from there.  This is a major problem for me.  I will keep this phone and will be purchasing iPhone 5G when it comes out next year.Edit: 12/18/10Previously I complained that there was no selection in downloading the pictures from the email to the gallery on the phone and that is still true.  However, about couple of days later I found that the photos were there in the gallery??!!  It took about few days before it actually got into the gallery?  There obviously is some sort of delay effect.  I'm happy that it did get to be downloaded into the gallery but it's annoying still to think that it took so long for it to do it.  Strange.  This is definitely a bug with this phone.</td><td>List(6, 12)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.995613420730894, 0.004386579269106122))</td><td>1.0</td><td>It's OEM, from HTC, for my MyTouch 4G.

I was hoping my experience with it would lean more towards positive.  Unfortunately, I am on the negative side and will be returning this.  My complaints match many of those detailed by the other negative reviews.  I understand that Belkin wanted to make something clean looking, simple to use, out of the way, so they went with this one button design.  Unfortunately, the implementation of the one button is all wrong.  What is wrong about the implementation is the difficulty that is encountered when doing something somewhat necessary when listening to music from your phone, skipping forward to the next track or jumping back to a previous track.  The instructions say to double tap or press to move forward and triple tap or press to move back.  Like another review said, this is not the same double or triple tap you might do on a mouse button, the taps have to almost be timed between each other get the expected result.  If the taps aren't timed correctly, you get the result of pausing the currently playing track.  Even knowing what has to be done may not matter, if it doesn't work with your model phone.  The device is clearly out of date and can't function completely with the phone models that are out now.  For example, I am not able to jump back to previous tracks using the triple tap with the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.Although I got this device to play and control my music without having to divert my attention from the road, I was also looking forward to using it for making and receiving calls.  The call quality is just OK.  The person on the other end of the one phone call I made said they could hear me, but it sounded like they were talking into a paper cup.  The car wasn't moving when I tested the call quality, so that was not a factor.Unfortunately, this product will not meet the requirements I have.

(Annoyingly loud.)4) The power cable connects awkwardly at the side.  Annoying if you're using this for anything other than recharging.5) The price.  I suspected this was the case, but I've since read numerous reviews that there are better sounding speakers for less money.  I found that hard to believe, but now I know its true.  I'm returning this speaker and spending about $80 less for a Logitech, JBL or Creative option.It seems to me that you're paying for kind of a cool package, bit of a well known name.

I recommend it highly.Discussion:Not readily evident is that a software download is required direct to the Jambone via PC browser connection to Jawbone web site.  Once discovered, it's easy, simple, it works, and the unit subsequently does exactly what it's supposed to do.In business application, it now provides entirely intelligible telephone voice reproduction in both directions via bluetooth connection to cell phone.  The microphone is excellent and offers clear pickup at considerable distance, making the unit perfect for roundtable conference calling, or simply for hands-free discussion one-on-one.For entertainment, the speakers are better than those in any notepad or laptop, but inferior to larger paired stereo sets such as those offered by Logitech.  Nonetheless, the Jambone emerges as preferable due to its acceptable (albeit limited) audio coupled with comparatively diminutive size.  Certainly better than nothing when packing for biz trips.Red color provides unmistakable reminder not to leave it behind after a tiring meeting.More weight to carry, but it's now standard stuff in the rolling briefcase.Downside:It weighs a ton (unavoidable if it's to provide adequate acoustics.)Still overpriced, but best game in town.Hint:The cardboard organizer (part of packaging, looks like a miniature cabinet) is nice, but a little goofy and certainly too ungainly to pack for travel.  I'd rather not have paid for this catchy packaging.  HOWEVER - pay attention - nearly invisible in the bottom compartment is a very nice soft travel case for the Jambone.

However, after about a month, it would not connect with my iPhone 4 Correctly.  I would be talking and it would unpair.  Then, after about four months of having this headset, the speaker (the one I hear the caller from) started to have very poor sound quality.  Now six months of owning it, it's dead.  The headset charges and the lights function correctly, however you cannot hear sound from the speaker what so ever.  Also, it wll not pair with my iPhone 4.  I thought maybe it was an issue with my phone, so I tried pairing with a friends HTC and a friends Blackberry, nothing.  There is no doubt in my mind that this product was broken from the start.  I owned another Motorola that I purchased new from a local retailer, and I owned that headset for 5 years and never had any of the problems I had with this product.  The only reason I had to buy a new headset was the battery stopped charging in my old one.  I feel that I more than got my moneys worth from it after using for five years.  I owned this Motorola H730 for a little over six months and it's useless.  This seller should take care of me as a customer and replace this product, however the time for me to return expired on June 5th, 2011.  And up until that time, it was working ok.  I was kinda uneasy about buying this product in the first place because it was advertised as brand new, however was not in a Motorola package.  But like I said, I felt better once I bought it, because it did work perfect the first couple of months.  All in all, i do not recommend buying this product.  Go to your local retail store, yes you have to pay a little more, but at the end of the day, it's worth the money because they will take care of you, the customer.</td><td>List(2, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9586660018960385, 0.04133399810396141))</td><td>1.0</td><td>This was sent to me by amazon to replace a charger previously purchased because it didn't work for my Android X.

Perhaps most annoying was a loud crackle that randomly happened at the beginning of calls.

It is critical that my voice be clear when doing this.  I am wiling to pay pretty much whatever I need to for a high quality headset for my phone.Microphone problems:I set the Jawbone ERA headset up and began using it on conference calls.  The feedback I immediately received was that my voice was changing pitch and timber while I was talking.  To test this out, I left myself voice mail messages with me talking in a constant and steady voice and noticed that my voice went from nature sounding to a high pitched and lower volumed computer voice-like sound in the middle of the sentence.  Since I wasn't walking about when leaving the message, I can only surmise that the noise reduction was technology was having a problem with my voice.  I tried to make sure the headset was contacting my cheek (as recommended in the manual for optimum sound handling), so am not sure why this issue arose.Sound volume is good:On a positive note, the sound for this headset is really nice.  It goes higher (though does start to distort when too loud) than other headsets I used, I really liked that quality of this headset.Sadly, in the end, I returned the headset since it performed poorly on the core need of mine for good microphone pickup.

Or perhaps you spend a lot of time in an area without 4G service. Just remember that even if you make a great phone choice, deficiencies in the other areas can diminish your overall user experience.Don't move to a smart phone without some research into these choices. Which provider? Which mobile operating system? Who can offer me the best service, or the best combination of value and service? The rest of this review assumes you've already figured out why a phone with the Android operating system might be a better choice for you than an iPhone, a Blackberry or a Windows-based smart phone solution...Bottom line for the HTC EVO 4G: feature loaded, user-friendly and a hard choice to go wrong with in a crowded smart phone market.The phone ships with an impressive array of capability and apps, and finding and installing new ones from the Android marketplace is easy even for non-techies.Two very strong performers in the pre-installed applications are Google-powered Voice Search and Navigate: both are eerily good at delivering search results and driving/walking directions. This phone's voice-to-text interface is also very good, and can be used for both composing text messages and delivering search results without typing. Surprisingly, a voice-based dialing app that is part of the operating system's collection of widgets seldom gets one right. The Evo's on-screen keyboard is adaptive to your compositions over time, and will suggest auto-completes for words you frequently type.The phone includes two cameras: an outward facing high resolution (8 megapixel) still/video camera, and a front facing 1.3 megapixel camera for video applications. It ships with an 8 GB microSD card. One surprising oversight of this phone is the placement of the microSD card inside the battery compartment. Although you can move files to an from it via the USB port, this phone would be improved if the card were accessible without removing the back cover.In addition to the USB port, the phone has a 3.5mm aux audio jack and an HDMI port.The rear of the phone includes a \"kickstand\", allowing you to stand the phone on a horizontal surface when viewing the display in landscape mode (great for using the speakerphone or watching videos).Customization of the scrolling display screens is intuitive. In our house, even less technically savvy users were re-arranging icons and applications in no time.Each of phone, video and still image quality are satisfactory.The overall finish of this phone is --literally-- quite slick. It can go sliding easily on leather car seat, and both the screen and frame will attract and display fingerprints. Whether or not you opted in to the damage/loss insurance that most providers offer, I'd strongly recommend both a screen protector and some case or holster to offer a modicum of protection to the phone.Mnay options exist for protection, but for our multiple Evo phones we've found the following to provide a good mix of protection and price:--\"Fishbone\" protective case (red linked here; other colors are available)--SGP STEINHEIL Anti FingerprintSprint Screen Protector (Anti Fingerprint)Let these protective devices soak up the wear and tear instead of your phone and display.Other reviews have discussed battery life, and it's worth addressing. This phone has five separate radio transmit/receive devices:-the standard cellular (3G/CDMA) transceiver-the 4G transceiver-Bluetooth (for short-range use of hands-free devices and data exchange)-GPS receiver-Wifi transceiverEach of these devices will exert its own demand on the battery. Selectively turning them off when not needed, along with setting a shorter time to turn off the display (2 minutes or 1 minute) will go a long way to mitigate the battery issue. Additionally, there are extended life aftermarket batteries (usually with an accompanying modified case cover to accommodate their their additional bulk) that will easily get you through your work day away from external power.A note about apps:Android is a Google operating system, and access to the Android marketplace for additional apps requires entry through a Google/Gmail account (either existing or one you create when setting up the phone). In return for the apps, be aware that you surrender significant personal information on your phone, your location (at minumum the nearest cell tower, and in some cases your GPS-derived location) and details of how you used the phone and applications. Providing this information is the cost of admission for functionality of the apps. I'm not offering a value judgement on this...just pointing it out for your information.Finally, a note about pricing:Comparison shop and pay attention when you're ready to make the move to a smart phone. For the hardware purchase, you can expect to find considerable differences in the prices (even when upgrade discount and rebates are included) from different vendors. Be sure to check out each each of your provider's \"store\" (brick and mortar, by phone and online), big box stores and even Amazon's new wireless store. It's worth investing a couple minutes in this research to save a considerable amount on the purchase price.Becoming a smart phone user begins with shopping smartly! )-</td><td>List(137, 144)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9911191968237737, 0.008880803176226372))</td><td>2.0</td><td>The volume control does a good job for me - I can hear people well which is a switch from many of the headsets I've tried. Another great thing is that once you have it on *properly* you really don't know it's there which can be a disadvantage, too. Once I found it hanging in my hair and had I not noticed I could have lost it for good. Getting it on *properly* is a whole 'nudder story. There's no quick way to pop this on my ear - it takes a lot of fidgeting to place it correctly. Needs to have a more adjustable/flexible around the ear section. Came with additional ear gels that I could not figure out how to use to save my soul. Very strange little buggers. Only ear gel I could use was to wide for my ear (painful at times) and did not go into my ear far enough but I seem to have the latter problem w/every headset I've tried.It's a nifty little package but the stone part is an unnecessary gimmick in my opinion. Would be great for tossing in my purse (to keep it safe from breakage) but in my opinion a headset should not need to be charged more than once a day even with heavy use. This one needs charging way to often, I should not have to carry the stone around w/me.I have a heckuva a time getting a headset to fit around and in my ear. Can't tell you how many headsets I've tried and returned or tried and tossed into my unusable headset pile. I do love the fact that it doesn't have a swivel mic - just something to break off and the fact that the ear gel would probably NEVER break off of this one like so many others is an added goody. Background noise for callers was acceptable - better than other headsets.Would not always reconnect when I'd get out of range and then back into range so there were many times I'd answer my phone but the headset would not be connected therefore, useless.

There are two styles offered: a smooth, glossy finish and a textured, matte finish.  The model I have is the textured and although it is made out of a polycarbonate material, it feels glove-leather soft.The headset, itself, is shaped like a strip of fruit skin that's been peeled.  It wraps around the ear and the speaker itself fits comfortably in the ear canal.  There's also two other earpieces included inside of the beautiful, if not elaborate, headphone case.Once on, the headset gives you instructions on how to connect it to your primary Bluetooth device.  After which, the headset will tell you how strong of a charge the headset has.  After having to forget to place it back into its shell for several days, the headset told me that the charge was strong.The broad part of the headset (the other side of the speaker) has a soft \"click\" mechanism.  This is the on/off switch.  The volume control, which is an invisible touchpad above it, is engaged by gently moving a finger up the headset--next to no pressure is needed.A2DP--wireless connection.  Flawless.  I have a separate prepaid phone as a business line and calling my main PDA, the headset will tell you \"Telephone # xxx--xxx-xxxx is calling.  Accept or Ignore?\"  At this point, accepting puts you into a conversation and ignoring returns you to the music you may have been listening to.There's no paperwork included, and to be honest, none is actually needed.  You just have to know where on your phone or Bluetooth device is the connection.  On Jabra's website, you can download the instruction manual or watch a Quickstart tutorial.  Also, the site gives you options to buy peripheral software that will allow you to have wireless- audio access to programs on your computer, especially iPod Touch, iPad and the iOS.  There's a Jabra device page set up on Apple's website for device compatibility.** Pro's And Con's.+ Extremely comfortable.  Feels like a soft earmuff.+ Long battery life, digital-strength indicator (voice.)+ A2DP connection works well.  (And, the ability to use the headset for voice-activated programs and virtual activities is extremely promising.)+ Audio reception.  For calls, the receivers had no idea in our conversation that I was wearing a headset, even outdoors.  Musically speaking, the reception changed with the bit rate of the songs I listened to.  In other words, all of the music did NOT sound the same.  (I wasn't looking for the highest audio fidelity because it is only for a single ear and I wouldn't want the company to compromise the other advancements in lieu of it.  I have premium headphones for that.)Con's-  Price.  The price in the past 4 weeks (as of the date of this published review, 3-3-11) ranged from $89- $130.  Having several other Bluetooth/ wireless headset devices, this one is above average.  If the \"better\" Bluetooth headsets are between $ 50- $60 during that year when it is released, I would say a reasonable price would be about $75- $80.  $130 is definitely not in my price range for a Bluetooth headset, but more importantly, I think it is overpriced even for a high-quality device such as it is.*** So... Stylish!  Comfortable!  Long battery life!  Audio connection/ corresponding fidelity and internet/ software-program compatibility all above par.  Price warrants a re-evaluation to something a bit more moderately priced.5 minus 1 equals 4 stars.</td><td>List(42, 48)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9132214770429998, 0.08677852295700021))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I saw this case at the cell phone store while my new Atrix was having account information clarified...The main piece, which fits over the phone, is superbly designed.  Snug, taut, feels great in the hand.  The phone feels secure.I even like the front piece of the case, which protects the screen.  It's still recommended to keep a separate screen protector over the phone due to risk of static build-up, but it's so much more valid protection for what is a great, and expensive, phone.The holster, however, is another story.  It's easy to not get the phone to fit in the holster while wearing it.  While in the holster, it feels somewhat secure, but the whole design gives me second thoughts on that belief.  Now, while there is a plus in that the holster is designed to have the front of the phone (glass screen) aimed at one's body (and not in the open!), the snap-in method is \"too easy to use\".  Too easy for potential problems to develop should it fall out.However, the good instantly outweigh the bad.  The Otter Defender is a GREAT case for this phone - it is simply the best and is worth the purchase price for it alone.  (And I've tried others, and even returned another decent case in favor of this Otter). But find something else as a holster.  With hands-on experience, I don't think it's the most secure design.Ideally, go to the store and look at it firsthand. Don't rely on user comments unless there's a fair amount of detail and reasoning, and sometimes pre-released reviews have SOME merit if there's an existing pattern already shown by the company making the product in question.  But I digress.  The rep I worked with was more than happy to demo my phone in it.

The sides of the phone have a chrome metallic look (it's still plastic) and the back has a texture rich plastic cover with a repeating cut diamond pattern. The top and bottom are beveled with a rubberized coating.  Plenty of thought went into the accents, color, and shape of this phone.  I have to commend Dell here; they sure know how to design the exterior of a mobile device.  Given its professional looks and general rarity among the common public, every time I pull my DVP out in a crowd I always get surprised and wondrous comments and questions.  There is also a micro-USB jack on the bottom, a 3.5\" headphone jack up top, a decent volume rocker on the right side, a dedicated camera button on the bottom right, power button up top and speaker and mic cut outs on the rubberized bottom.  Keeping the speaker and mic off the back of the phone helps when using the speakerphone options, but the power button is a little more difficult to hit than I'd like.  I've gotten used to it over time, but it still could be more accessible.The outside of the phone might win beauty pageants, but the internals were a big question mark.  All WP7 devices to date have a mandatory 1GHz processor, so it is not a surprise to find that here.  But the amount of RAM in the device was a mystery until recently.  Dell originally listed the Venue Pro has having 512MB of RAM on its website, but it removed that spec.  Third party apps reported the device as only having 256MB of RAM.  Posts in forums suggest that the 3rd party apps might not be able to recognize all of the RAM.  But with the new firmware update there is a correct reporting of 512MB of RAM.  This is a huge relief since Microsoft will be releasing a software update soon that incorporates more RAM-intensive multitasking capabilities.The keyboard on the device is high quality, especially if you prefer the portrait format.  Each button has a satisfying click and travel distance, although I still slightly prefer the feel of jelly-like buttons on Palm portrait keyboards. The slider mechanism feels solid and has a good snap to it.  Since the home screens and many of the native apps within WP7 are either exclusively portrait, or favored towards a portrait format, the DVP's keyboard can be considered more useful than the LG Quantum or HTC Arrive.  The complication is the heft of the phone.  This thing feels like a brick in your hand, usually in a good way, but when the keyboard is open it does require larger sized hands to be able to comfortably hold the device, type on the keyboard and reach up to the tap the screen.  An open DVP in small hands is a disastrous fumble waiting to happen.SCREENThe screen is AMOLED technology sporting the standard WP7 resolution of 800 x 480.  Only the Samsung Focus's Super AMOLED screen is better among WP7 devices.  The DVP has deep blacks and fast response during gameplay and video playback.  Images are sharp and crisp.  The only real downside is that it washes out in direct sunlight easily.PHONE/RADIOSThe call quality on the phone is a notch above average.  I haven't experienced any significant call drops.  The earpiece provides good voice quality and people have said that the DVP's mic is clear.  The volume is sufficient for 95% of environments, but there have been select times outside where I wish I could bump the volume up an additional 10-15%.While I haven't had many problems using WiFi, I do know that it has been widely reported that some devices freeze up when using WiFi and browsing the Marketplace.  It seems like this is more likely to occur in the 16GB models and could have been the result of a faulty micro SD card (the DVP has a micro SD card that is buried under the SIM slot not meant to be tampered with).  However, the firmware update seems to have fixed this problem.  I haven't had a single Marketplace WiFi crash with it yet.The Bluetooth EDR 2.1 pairs and works with my Plantronics headsets, and my car.  However, I have come across a curious circumstance that if I connect to my car, turn off my car and leave the DVP's Bluetooth on and come back to my car the next day, it would only automatically pair with my car half the time.  The other half of the time I had to go into the DVP settings and turn the Bluetooth off and back on.  With the firmware update, that is a problem of the past.  Bluetooth pairing with my car now works like it should.CAMERAThe firmware update has improved the camera, but it was, and remains the most disappointing aspect of the phone.  I have low expectations for cameras on phones, but the camera on the DVP now barely meets my minimal requirements.  In sunlight it is possible to shoot quality 5MP images and 720p video.  But as soon as the lighting drops to average indoor lighting, the camera's quality seems to drop exponentially.  The flash provides little help, only provides benefit with 3 feet, and can cause color wash out.  The firmware update shifted the camera performance from abysmal to very average. So if high camera quality is one of your top 2 or 3 requirements for a phone, then I'd probably go with the Focus or Quantum if you want to stick with a WP7 device.PERFORMANCEEven before the update my Venue Pro performed most WP7 tasks smoothly.  From a speed and responsiveness standpoint, first party apps are generally flawless and a pleasure to scroll through.  Third party apps can sometimes be hit or miss, but this feels like a WP7 problem and not a problem stemming from the hardware.  The only time I worried about the performance from the phone is the occasion Xbox LIVE game.  A game that has a rich, always moving 3D environment, such as Glyder, previously suffered from slowdown hiccups.  The slowdown can partially be remedied by resetting the phone and directly returning back into the Xbox LIVE hub.  The slowdowns seen in some games have been improved upon the addition of the new firmware update.SUMMARYWhile there were negative aspects and question marks pertaining to the DVP, overall, I still really like the device.  The Copy & Paste NoDo update made mobile Office an outstanding piece of software.  It is, well--powerful to be able to use real Power Point on the phone.  I can download a .pptx file from my SkyDrive, practice the presentation with working, accurate animations, make quick edits, and email it off to where it needs to go.  Quick Office or Docs To Go do not work as smoothly with .pptx files as WP7 does.  I'm also an Xbox LIVE addict, so I recognize that earning achievement points on the go carries more weight with me.  And I've been a long-time Zune Pass subscriber and being able to download pretty much any song, at any time, directly to my phone is a huge perk.Combined with the efficient portrait keyboard, curved AMOLED display and gorgeous body the DVP is a great choice for anyone looking for something besides iOS and Android.  The DVP used to come up just short.  The firmware issues and a botched initial release killed the tremendous momentum that the DVP had leading up to the WP7 launch.  But hey, better to fulfill the prophecy late than never, right?When initially released, the DVP could have been docked a star or two, but I hope discussing how the firmware bumped the phone up to 5 stars was helpful to people on the market for a new smartphone.EXTRA UPDATE - MANGO WP7.5I originally wrote this review about a month before the Mango update rolled out.  I've been using this phone for a year total now, and have received the NoDo update, the aforementioned firmware update, and have now had the Mango WP7.5 software update for about 3 months.  With the firmware update and Mango this phone is highly competitive in the current smartphone scene.  I know you can find plenty of Mango reviews out there, but the stability improvements on the DVP are noticeable.  Since updating to Mango I've probably had to reset my phone a total of 5-6 times, and only once did I have to pull the battery out in three months for a hard reset.  My Android-using friends typically have to reset their phones once every two days.You want completely free, turn-by-turn GPS directions with voice prompts and traffic warnings?  It's here on the Mango DVP now.  While you can talk to Siri on an iPhone with casual voice commands, please be aware that you can essentially do all of the same things on a Mango Windows Phone.  Just say, \"Open Weather,\" and my DVP shows me the forecast.  Say, \"Open Minesweeper\" and the game starts, say \"Chinese Food,\" and you're presented with a list of Chinese restaurants and recipes.  I can also conveniently and easily dictate text messages in the car with Speech-to-Text.  Simply hit the search button at the bottom of the phone, then the eyeball icon and the camera turns on and I can scan bar codes and Qcodes in real time to find the best prices on merchandise.  The camera app has been improved so that it saves custom settings now.  Twitter and Facebook are even more tightly integrated.  I use the DVP as a remote to navigate my Xbox 360's menus on the HDTV.  I can choose to group only 3 out of my 5 email inboxes together into 1 Live Tile, effectively keeping my work email inboxes separate from my grouped personal email inboxes.  The WP app marketplace has over 50,000 apps as of this review update.  Can you follow your favorite obscure band with an app that is available for iPhone?  Maybe not.  But can you check your flight status with a Delta app, or your prescription with a Walgreens app, or showtimes with a Flixster app, or stream a movie with a Netflix app, or do anything else that is associated with a remotely popular/mainstream app on WP?  Absolutely.  All in all, this is a highly competitive and complete phone.  You don't have to limit yourself to a 3.5\" screened iPhone or an Android phone that may never receive an OS update if you don't want to.  You really do have a choice now.  iPhones and Android devices might still be the best pick for some people, but you really can consider a WP device as a legit 3rd player before you make a purchase.  And if you want a 4.1\" screen WP phone with a beautiful display and a Palm or Blackberry-ish portrait keyboard, the Dell Venue Pro still holds up well today, 1 year after it's release.</td><td>List(100, 104)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9585033978615226, 0.0414966021384775))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I purchased this phone for the capability to receive GPS instructions and musicI have been totally pleased with the performance and the ease which it will connect (and inform you when it disconnects).

I had a really crap one that didn't make it a week before i just canned it.  I bought 2 Motorola ones for about $15 and the sound quality was entirely garbage and the return policy from that vendor was also crap.  Another $30 gone.  I bought a nice Plantronics and it was nice for a while. But it got lost.  A second Plantronics was given to me from a friend who got a newer car and again, it was decent.  It stopped charging, though.I'm really liking this Jabra.  I use it to stream music when i'm working in the yard.  I use it for calls in the car.  It's sensitive but not too much so.  Someone on the other end can hear the person sitting beside me talk, but not tons of junk surrounding us.It's comfortable to wear and my sunglasses fit alongside the base that goes behind the ear.This is also the first bluetooth that I've had to turn the volume down.  I use the ear piece goes into the ear, and the sound quality is great, without drowning out everything like an ear plug.  There are replacements available on Amazon for a reasonable price.I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a nice ear piece.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.740391311162998, 0.2596086888370021))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I had a Plantronics Voyager that I've been using for over a year.

If it had not worked out I would have returned it for the Voyager Pro.  But, it is working well, is comfortable.  I can hear folks very well and they can hear me.

Nonetheless, I have several wrinkles left from installation and the surface is almost like a gel. It is easily scratched and does not return to a flat surface despite what the manufacturer claims. Most of the water bubbles do eventually disappear and the screen is easily viewed. Nonetheless, I do not think this screen protector is of the same quality as some of the others I have used in the past. The issues with the proximity sensor have been resolved, so that is a plus. Also, it is less expensive than some of the plastic protectors. On the whole, it is adequate.UPDATE: This company has wonderful customer service. They read my review and sent me additional instructions and a new screen protector. I have raised my review from 3 to 4 stars based on the customer service.

Add a screen protector and you'll have moderate protection for your pricey iPhone 4/4S. It would have received 5 stars, except the &#34;cassette reel holes&#34; do not properly align with the Apple logo on the back of the phone.

I've read many reviews where people say this is a smart phone and it really isn't. It may be smarter than some phones, but it is no where near an iPhone 4s or other android devices. The people that are saying that they see no reason to spend money on a smart phone have obviously never owned a smart phone. That being said, this phone is feature laden for the price and does most things well.The price is great, the monthly plans are an excellent value, but the only thing I really, really hate about this phone, is the positioning of the \"browser\" button. It is far too easy to hit this when returning to the home screen and doing so causes the browser to open and you are almost immediately debited 1 minute. This may not sound like much, but it happens repeatedly and it adds up. I am not a conspiracy theorist so I'll assume it's just bad design. Until you get used to it, this could be a money drain so I'll just have to teach my child to be more careful. Note that if you are on the offered unlimited plan this won't be an issue, but given the wide array of plan options, I chose to start with a lesser plan as a trial run.It's a good, inexpensive phone and I think it will serve the needs of my child well, but as an iPhone user, I could never, ever replace my true smart phone with this.

I like it.  I have had several other pre-paid cellphones from Net10 and it's Sister company, Tracfone. I have found the battery life in this one to be very good. The screen size if good also, not huge, but for this type of phone, very good, in fact, a Friend of mine has a Blackberry phone, side by side, they look alike.  I like the idea of easy access to the sd memory card, It's located right on the side of the phone, you dont have to take out the battery to get to it. Currently, I have a 4gb micro sd card in it.  It's bluetooth works very well with my Car's bluetooth. As far as Texting goes, I have found this to be very easy to text with, even using one hand. I also like the way you can purchase minutes for this, either online or buying a card at a local store that carries them. They also have a $15 a month plan too, the minutes carry over, if you talk alot, this one may be for you.  I have done the minutes several different ways. Using the monthly plan is a very good idea, but I do not like having a monthly pay out commitment on a phone. I choose refilling the minutes online. I have not been dissappointed in this phone. I reccomend it! UPDATE: 7-21-12 I thought I would try to save even more by using a tracfone with triple minutes for life. As it turned out, Neither phone I used with them could hold a candle to the LG900G, I'm returning to it next week. This phone rules! UPDATE 8-25-12 Again, tried using yet another triple minute for life tracfone, The LG900G Wins again, Hands down, a Phone that fits my needs, worth the extra service days cost.UPDATE: 10-26-2013 This Phone is the Workhorse of My Fleet, so to speak when it comes to my cellphones.UPDATE: 05-02-2014: Went with the Android thing for awhile and now want to start curtailing my spending.

Phones like i9100, GT-i9500, and SGH-S730M have no warranties, contrary to what is documented or written in literature. Samsung relies on the companies they sell products through like AT&T, T-Mobile to handle repair issues. I had two other friends with the same i9100 phones, have the phone stop working 2 weeks after it's last software update to 4.1. It appears that at some point in time Samsung sabotages older products via updates, forcing customers to buy newer released products. For repairs on all products not supported by AT&T, Sprint, etc., Samsung product support in the USA will not support these phones and will refer you to Samsung support in other countries. The support in other countries will place you on hold while they &#34;look into it&#34;, then tell you they will call you back. In our experience, Samsung never returns calls. When calling back to support, Samsung support says that the call is escalated to managers via eMail, but you will never receive a call or any action. All Samsung technical support is incompetent as to how their products function. I even went as far as sending my phone internationally to a repair center, which their repair center lied about repairing the phone, returned it NOT repaired, and charged my credit card. Report Samsung corrupt business practices to the FTC (Federal Trade Commission). Reports can be filed on-line at the FTC website.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8569890056723238, 0.14301099432767614))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Headphones were returned as they only played out of one side.

They connected easily to my Android phone, and sounded good with Pandora, bTunes, even on phone calls. They even sounded great. The problem was they hurt my outer ears a lot. There was tremendous pressure on the tops of my ears. Obviously, I tried to adjust the fit, in accordance with the directions and the picture on the Motorola website of someone wearing them. Nothing seemed to work. Today, after running 7 miles in them, I decided to return them. 10 minutes later, I realized that the part that was hitting the top of my ears was supposed to go behind the ears. They now feel great, and I'll definitely be keeping them. They even sound better when worn correctly.Before you discount what I'm saying, or assume that I'm a complete moron for not knowing how to wear headphones, be warned that the directions for wearing them, and the picture on the Motorola website imply that you are supposed to wear them incorrectly.Now that I'm wearing them correctly, here are the things they do well:+ Sound Great+ Connect easily+ Switch between calls and music seamlessly+ Feel comfortable, though they are quite a bit heavier than any other headphones, even the older Motorlas (S-9 and S9-HD)+ Very well made.+ The battery life is exceptional and you can charge it off micro-USB.The owner's manual is pretty much useless. The format is tiny, and they put more effort into being hip than providing a useful manual for the product. Fortunately, it is intuitive to use.The price on these is reasonable, considering what you get and what it can do. I bought mine at Best Buy because Amazon didn't have them yet, and the third party sellers that have them on here are kind of pricey.I highly recommend that you buy these. I think that you will love them, once you figure out how to fit them.//update August 24th, 2011 //After having these for a year, I decided to buy another pair to see if they have changed at all. They have but only cosmetically. Although the old ones continue to work well, the second generation of these has some slight changes. One of the many things that hasn't changed is the model number and name. The way to tell the second generation from the first is that the white material that touches your head next to your ears is now red. Also the black plastic on the back/top of them is shiny instead of muted. The performance seems to be the same with the new ones as the old ones, though the buttons are a little easier to operate and the battery life appears to be longer.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8183913931204452, 0.18160860687955482))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I bought the Motorola S10-HD to use with my Droid X.

I lost my Plantronics Voyager 520, which I used for over 3 years (was not great, but at the time I purchased it was well priced and it served its purpose).  So I first ordered another Plantronics M50 that was decently reviewed on Amazon.  I thought I was buying a new one but when I received it, in its \"bulk package\", it had a little paper stating \"Limited Warranty - Refurbished Products\".  But the worst thing is that it would not pair to my Samsung Galaxy S3.  So I returned it.I then decided to look for a Samsung earpice, and found this one.  Just by changing the position of the ear hook the front cover came off.  So I thought it could be snapped back in . . . wrong:  it actually came off and I will have to glue it back in, if it is even possible.  So I am holding it with a rubber band now.  &lt;sigh>Additionally, the little cover at top for the power connection immediately broke too . . . I would think I am overly strong or careless, but this is the *only piece of electronics I own where these breakages have happened*, and I've worked in IT for 20+ years.Finally, the part you insert in your ear is very large for mine, and it cannot be adjusted.  After just a few minutes it makes my ear hurt badly.  I've resorted to barely place it in, and trust that the hook will keep it more or less in place, but I think this way you lose the quality of sound and noise removal.Not happy at all with the item, and since it is broken in two places, I don't think I can return it.  $32 thrown away (BTW, I see the price has now gone down to $27, in just a few days).I would not recommend it.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8378193649767868, 0.1621806350232133))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I received 1500 batteries, not 1800 as another review stated.

Not worth the hassle of shutting down my phone and changing the battery every hour.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8740024556676118, 0.12599754433238822))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I use this device to transmit a DirecTV satellite receiver output to my earbuds (plugged into a cheap $24.00 Bluetooth audio adapater from Wally World), about 15' across the room. The manual says to keep the transmitter within 5 feet of the receiving device, which, if that were the case, I would have returned it. At 15' there is no breakup or background noise. The audio quality is far superior to what I had been using: an FM transmitter (common for car stereo setups) to a Sony Walkman am/fm radio on FM. While the latter setup works, there is a lot of background noise and cross/same channel interference because the Sony FM portable receives so many FM stations that there is always interference. Also, moving around (like rolling over), causes the signal to come and go on FM, hence my desire to try a Bluetooth solution)This is where Bluetooth comes in. No interference whatsoever, No problem pairing this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World Bluetooth receive adapter (which also works very, very well). I am taking the line level out of the DirecTV receiver and using the supplied adapter cable that came with the transmitter to get the audio from the sat receivre to the transmit adapter. I leave the transmit adapter plugged in all the time to the provided charging cable (a simple USB wall charger). On the receive side, the Wally World receive adapter is also powered all the time. Both devices appear to have an internal Li-ion battery, but they can both be left on charge power during normal use without risk to the batteries.The transmit adapter is about 1\" square and 1/8\" thick, weighs next to nothing. The cheap Wally World receive adapter is very similar in size and weight, and it has the standard 1/8\" (3.5 mm) stereo jack output)If you want to duplicate this setup, keep in mind we are using \"line level\" audio, so there is no volume control. As it turns out, the audio level is perfect for night time listening with just a common set of \"Frogz\" ear buds. If I felt I needed volume control, I could find a set a ear buds with built in volume control, but so far, there is no need. The line levels are quiet enough to not \"keep me awake\", but certainly loud enough for clearly understandable  dialog.N.B. Concerning the \"delay\" referenced in other reviews: Using it on the DirecTV sat receiver, there is a perceptible delay, but it is very, very slight. If I look really hard to spot this \"issue\", I can see it now and then...and to be honest, that problem manifests all on its own from DirecTV without any bluetooth transmitter. Nevertheless, there is \"some\" delay, however slight, but not enough to confuse or even mildly annoy me. Further, I got it to \"fall asleep\" to, so most of the time I have the TV off when listening to this setup. I did make a point, however, of evaluating the delay carefully before writing this review. It is possible that each device may show differing delays, but I don't see the kind of delays that some have written  about. Maybe I will in the future, but so far, there just isn't any issue. Maybe the pairing of this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World receiver adapter is just a happy marriage. Who knows?Highly recommended (both transmitter and receiver).</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7280284175613214, 0.2719715824386786))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Didn't like the fit & finish of these.They don't fit well into the phone and I'm afraid they would ruin the phone's charger plug.Both were returned promptly</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8131861921603165, 0.1868138078396836))</td><td>1.0</td><td>You would think a cable would work but this piece of garbage just won't carry a charge to any of our phones and we tried it with multiple chargers.

Motorola did that right.  Pairing this with my phone took all of 10 seconds.  Subsequent pairings when I return to the car are even easier -- just turn the device on.The device looks nice, and has a slim profile.  The clip works great with my visor, but it's not removable (which makes it awkward if you want to use it as a stand-up speaker) or reversable for other kinds of visors.The battery is decent, and this is where I subtracted a star.  It advertises 45 hours talk, and 6 months standby.  What??! I've had the unit for about 4 weeks.  It came charged to 'medium' and went to 'low' within two weeks.  I gave it a full charge, and it's already back to 'medium'.  I talk for maybe 30 minutes a day, and completely turn it off when I'm not using it.  Expect to give this a full charge every month -- or week if you're a heavy user.Also, you cannot charge this device while charging another.  I have a charge splitter so I an charge my headset and phone at the same time.  It would not work with this speakerphone.The volume is usually pretty good.  I can hear others and they can usually hear me.  It's slightly worse than my Bluetooth headset, which doesn't suck.  Everyone could tell I was on a speakerphone, but they could almost always hear me.I was VERY impressed by how quickly the device turns on and pairs with my phone.  I just sit down, flip the switch, and it's ready in about 1.5 seconds.I do wish that it would resume the pairing though.  In other words, if I leave the car and bring my phone with me, then return to the car 5 minutes later, I have to turn the speaker off and back on.  It's quick and easy, but it would be nice if it just re-linked itself.So despite a few limitations, it's not bad.  Great price for what you get, and that makes this a winner.-----Update June 21, 2012:  Still using the speaker, and I think the battery issues I wrote about earlier have somehow resolved themselves, or maybe I was being to critical with an early review.  It seems I need to fully charge the device about every 2-3 months, when I use it about 5-10 minutes a day.  It does go from Medium to Low rather quickly, but stays on High for a good amount of time.  So now, when it hits Medium, I just bring it into the house for the night to charge.  I still wish it were louder, and automatically reconnected to my phone when I return to the car more than 5 minutes later.  It also has an annoying habit of repeatedly connecting and losing connection if I am standing about 10' away from the car.</td><td>List(0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9766502179669737, 0.023349782033026265))</td><td>2.0</td><td>The sounds clarity isn't as good at all times.

I bought it as soon as I saw it. Coming from an Atrix 4g.  The first thing I noticed is, while 3g lights up, on AT&T; the speeds are laughable.  I'm talking 200 - 400 kbs download on 3g, 100 kbs upload.  Very poor.  I quadruple checked everything was correct...new SIM, correct plan (had AT&T; change me away from 4g plan) and correct APN settings.  Nothing worked.  I went to an AT&T; store and the clerk was nice enough to help me with this phone, even though it's intended for the Canadian market (no US warranty).  He triple checked everything and speedtests continued to show ~400 kbs data speeds.  Ridiculous.I'm very close to returning this phone as, while the 3g light illuminates, it's so slow and takes forever to download a simple app from the appstore.  Streaming media (radio / slingbox) forget it.I really want to like it but there is clearly something wrong with my plan or the phone itself.  I don't know how to get good speeds.  Oh, I'm on 2.3.4 also.  No dice, still slow.***June 18, 2011 edit:***Well, I tried again.  I ordered the Nexus S to give it another shot (perhaps my first was defective?).  Amazon's product listing clearly states the model being sold is the I9020A, which is compatible with US AT&T; bands.  I purchased from TRD Trading and guess what arrived?  The I9023 version (SLCD) which was produced for the French market and only gets EDGE in the US.  Also, it has no warranty despite the product listing saying \"US Warranty.\"  Amazon really screwed this listing up and sellers will get droves of returns (mine's going back today) if it continues to go unchecked.  It's simple, really.  There are three versions of the Nexus S, and it appears Amazon and it's resellers ship whatever version they so wish even though the listing says I9020A.I9020T - intended for T-Mobile.  Carries USA warranty.I9020A - intended for Rogers in Canada and has the correct bands for USA AT&T; 3g.  No US warranty.I9023 - intended for Europe.  Will NOT work with AT&T; 3g.

If you are looking for a sleek, thin, stylish fashion statement you should probably consider another case.  However if you are looking for protection and peace of mind.  This case should work well for you.I have had three of these cases since June of 2011.  The first I managed to pull off the top cover for the headphone jack and Griffin replaced it with out too much trouble.  The second one had the same issue after only two or three months.  They did not replace this one because I had cut off the camera flap.  The third is the one I am reviewing that I just ordered from Amazon a few days ago.Now that the back story is out of the way here's the review.Fit and Finish:This case is made very well.  It should withstand just about anything accept for full submersion in water.  It has a plastic inner shell that snaps together and a rubber outer shell that goes on the outside.  I have noticed that they have improved this latest model of the case with a much grippier feeling rubber shell as well as a place to hold down the camera flap.  Although it's still very hard to get it to stay there.  All openings are covered and easily accessible.  I think Griffin have also made the covering for the home button more recessed so it's harder to accidentally press but I can't be sure as I threw away my old case.  Please comment below if you have noticed this or not.Things I liked:1.  great protection2.  no problems using flash on the iPhone 4s3.  built in screen protector that you don't have to install (it's part of the case)4.  removable belt clip/kickstand5.  I'm not worried about dropping my phone anymore, I sure wish Apple would design a phone that's not so fragileThings I didn't like:1.  over time this case becomes a bit creaky (makes noise when you squeeze it in your hand while holding it)2.  outer layer stretches over time3.  attracts dust and grime4.  hard to get into a pants pocket if you don't want to use the belt clipWould I buy it again.YesOther thoughts:One big design change I would make if I could is to put the hard plastic layer on the outside and the rubber on the inside.  I'd make the outside out of a hard soft touch materiel.The bottom line is even with it's flaws I feel much better with this case on my phone.  I know that I can't break my phone unless it lands in standing water or I run over it with a lawnmower or something like that.UPDATE: 2/27/12that camera flap drove me mad so I returned this case and went back to the CaseMate Tough case, it doesn't give as much protection but it's so much less frustrating</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6844682849081565, 0.3155317150918434))</td><td>1.0</td><td>It did not fit for my charger or any other samsung s2 in my house and I do not have the time nor want to go through the returning steps.</td><td>List(2, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8895760191184718, 0.11042398088152824))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Otterbox make amazing cases that protect phones like no other.

Hands-free phone calls (making and receiving,) MP3 player going into my Mustang's Aux in plug, navigation, trip videos, car home app (speedometer, etc) and so forth. Needless to say, I use up some juice and no phone or tablet battery ever lasts long enough the way I abuse them. With the Saitechi, I leave them plugged in and just go to town. I also added a Nexus 7 to my car to run Torque (real-time engine diagnostic and monitoring app)and my battery never discharges.I never have to worry if my batteries are fully charged because by the time I get where I'm going, anything I plug in is topped off.Since this thing puts out an amazing 2.1A, you could probably put a splitter in and charge two devices at once with no problem.It looks great with its ultra-low profile design and the colorful indicator fits every car's color scheme.The fold-out handle makes it \"easy-peasy\" to remove when you change vehicles.I have used this one in my Mustang, wife's SUV, our motorhome and boat with no issues ever.I paid about $15 for mine and it is worth every penny, but for under ten bucks - are you kidding me?

I own similar devices which charge via USB ports using the cigarette lighter in my car, but all of the others do not fit as close to flush as this one does.I was a bit baffled as to what the 'smart converter' (included with this package) would do for me, but per the Satechi site a smart converter: \"...enhances capability with devices that cannot be charged through data cable.\"2100mA power from two USB ports will support the charging of most smartphones and tablets at the same time from this adaptor, making it a very useful and inexpensive addition to any vehicle.  I was able to charge both my iPhone 4S and iPad mini easily and fairly quickly with cords that came with the devices.  (NOTE: No charging cords come with this product; you must supply your own per each device's requirements.)The iPad 3 will charge using this device, however very slowly.  If you have an iPad 3 as I do, the best charging option is still USB into the AC adapter: USB AC Adapter for Apple iPhone 3, 4, iPad, iPod (Black).The most important feature to me of this adapter is the short circuit protection. You can't overload it, and blow a fuse, which I've done a few times with other similar devices. It also has shut down protection, which protects your devices. A blue light tells you when the adapter is properly connected, which some may find distracting, but I liked it.This is a good product.  Simple to operate, works as expected for (2) devices, and inexpensive.  I would have liked to have had some literature included that had brief directions and recommendations for use with the product that included warranty info (1 year per the Satechi site).I would recommend this to anyone who wants to inexpensively add USB charging functionality to their vehicle.</td><td>List(3, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9999129939711139, 8.70060288860107E-5))</td><td>3.0</td><td>At least, that's what people would tell you.  Realistically I find it to be a combination of the two.  Anyway, this review is specific to comparison of 4G devices, NOT jumping from a 3G device to this.I have owned the Thunderbolt since the early days of 4G.  It has its issues, especially if you don't root it.  But one thing about the Thunderbolt: I know what to expect of it day to day.  I've only had one instance of erratic behavior and it hasn't happened since.  I recently considered the Charge as a potential superior battery replacement to the Thunderbolt.  What I found was rather shocking.First, the build quality of the Charge is identical to its 3G brothers; the Fascinate, Captivate, Vibrant.  Cheap plasticky shell with no real feeling of durability.  However, the Charge's side bezel reminds me of a BlackBerry Curve the way it's designed.  I'm sure that wasn't accidental.  From a general solidity perspective the Thunderbolt and the LG Revolution both run circles around the Charge.  If you're the type of person who likes a feather light phone you probably won't really care.  To put it in perspective, I would get this for a girl in a hot minute.But what I found intriguing about the Charge is that it does get superior battery life to the Thunderbolt.  The problem is why: the Charge has many network-related issues that cannot be explained, and no real clear way to work around these issues.  First, the phone took hours to actually activate.  Apparently the software has been configured to auto-activate itself, but this failed numerous times.  I had to continually power cycle to get it to finally click through and accept the activation, and even then it still said it wasn't activated on the last reboot.  Next, the phone struggled to maintain a 4G signal, even when the Thunderbolt right next to it was surfing along happily on 4G with no hiccups.  That indicates a problem with the reception for the phone...and given the case material for the Thunderbolt, I would expect it to have more issues than the Charge, but realistically the Thunderbolt seemed better capable of maintaining a 4G signal.  Once connected to 3G it was of course rock solid, but you don't buy a 4G phone to do 3G, so I was thusly disappointed with this.  It's unfortunate, because outside of the build quality, I might have been tolerant of everything else, but the inability to sustain 4G is a dealbreaker for me.  Unfortunately I can't prove it to the local Verizon Wireless store because they don't even get 4G in there.  It's a miracle they manage to sell any such phones.Where the Charge exceeded over the Thunderbolt is in general microphone and speaker quality.  The Charge's microphone was able to recognize my voice extremely well, and the speaker is at least twice as loud as the Thunderbolt on the loudest setting.  There are also some vocal quality settings you can adjust on the Charge that are not present on the Thunderbolt.  Additionally, the Chaarge seemed less affected by wind noise than the Thunderbolt.I'm not suggesting you steer away from this phone if you're in a strong 4G area, but I am warning you that even though the signal might be strong, you may still experience issues staying connected to 4G.  Even if it does connect, you might not be able to browse, which indicates a connection issue.  The Thunderbolt at least has a way around this by way of programmer codes; the Charge presently has no such codes.  The other issue is that HTC is more apt to update the software than Samsung, so you may be stuck with older firmware, as is what happened with the Fascinate.There are other features that I have purposely glossed over, such as the Touchwiz interface and such.  But I do so because I want the reader to understand that the biggest, most important feature of any phone is the ability to handle its calls and data (if applicable) properly.  If a phone is sold as a 4G phone, it better be able to do 4G with minimal issues.  I'm not suggesting the Thunderbolt doesn't have its share of issues.  Rather, I had substantially less data and call issues with the Thunderbolt than with the Charge.  If you decide on the Charge, make sure you are happy with it, run it through its paces, and don't be afraid to return it if it doesn't work for you.</td><td>List(11, 13)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8599319414335653, 0.1400680585664347))</td><td>1.0</td><td>When I first got this about 30 days ago it worked great. It holds the PlayBook at a great angle and charges it very quickly - about 2 hours from near empty to 100%.The problem is with the connector.The base has a magnetic connector that includes three spring loaded pins. The pins extend to make contact with the three cupped connectors on the PB side of the connection.After many uses (and probably a few where the PB was inadvertently put in upside down - hey, it happens) the springs stop working very well and they no longer make a connection.If the middle one fails, you will know because the PB will not get that charging lightning bolt. However, if either of the sides stop working, you will still get the lightning bolt, but it will NOT charge.This problem is well documented on the Crackberry website. It has nothing to do with the battery percentage accuracy - which is a totally different issue.At first it will be an intermittent problem, but then it will be permanent.For the price, they really should have tested this better. They will end up with lots of returns and will have to redesign the stand end of the connector.As noted, when it was working, it was spectacular.</td><td>List(66, 81)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5926479054493797, 0.40735209455062027))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I am skipping the detailed positive review since this unit works very well.So far I got two problem:- If you clip this thing to your car's visor, make sure you return your visor to it's original position before you exit the car.

I have used their phones for almost 7 years, from the slider, the i6XX series, the i7XX series, the Black Jack I and II, Captivate and now the Infuse.I was hoping for a new 4G Phone from Samsung would be exciting, without the lags (as in Samsung Galaxy Captivate), with an enriched Android experience (with Android 2.3), and a configuration to provide maximum functionality. SAMSUNG FAILED ON THESE COUNTS. The new Samsung Infuse 4G is a poor and inferior imitation of the European version (Samsung Galaxy S2) released in Asia and Europe earlier in the year.But, is it intentional to provide the US market with an inferior product?Samsung released earlier in 2011 a sister phone to the Samsung Galaxy Infuse called the Samsung Galaxy S2. This phone is released in Asia and Europe but it embodies most of the functionality to provide you with a unique experience and functional excellence. However, though the version we received in the USA is the latest, it is much more inferior to the Asian and European version.The Asian version (Samsung Galaxy S2) has the following distinctions:- 1GB RAM, as opposed to the 512MG RAM for the Infuse.- Processor is dual core for the S2, as opposed to single core for the Infuse.- The S2 come pre-loaded with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), as opposed to Android 2.2 (Froyo) for the Infuse.Well, one may suggest that the specifications for the device were worked out with the US carriers. However, same experience of providing the US market with lower-end devices (compared to the versions in Europe and Asia) occurred when the last generation of Samsung Galaxy devices (Galaxy S). Example is the Samsung Galaxy Captivate and its sister device in Europe and Asia..Can anyone explain why Samsung is dumping lower grade specifications in the US Market? And the second slap on our faces is that we pay expensively for these devices as well. We are Americans and we should have at least devices of similar specifications!Avoid this device. Check out other makers coming out later in the year!My disappointments with the Samsung Galaxy Infuse:- Single core processor (compared with the dual-core processor on the Samsung Galaxy S2 for Europe and Asia). Dual-core processor enhances speed and responsiveness on the device.- 512 MB of RAM (compared with 1G of RAM on the Samsung Galaxy S2 for Europe and Asia).- Not running on Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) for a better Android experience.  (Other makes of Android devices were already on Android 2.3 in year 2010.) Given Samsung's and AT&T;'s lack of responsiveness in updating their devices, owners will have a long and frustrating experience.Recommendation:- Wait for a better device later in the year or shop other brands!- If you need a phone immediately, go for the HTC Inspire of Motorola Atrix. The refurbished ones (i.e. with boxes opened) are cheaper than dirt on AT&T;!- Best option is stay with your current device until later in the year. A device with dual core processor with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and 1G RAM will provide a unique experience, especially if you serve the net and play video games with large files. (I hear a Galaxy S2 phone, with dual core processor and Gingerbread will be out in a couple of months.)- I will return my phone and wait for something better. (I currently have the Samsung Captivate and I am frustrated with the lags, inaccurate GPS, and frequent freezes. Also, it took AT&T; and Samsung a long time to update the device from Android 2.1 to Android 2.2. If you are familiar with Samsung phones in the last year, you will know that the software updater, Kies, that they provided for the US customers was not functioning properly. In Europe and Asia, the software updated was a full version. In the USA, they released the \"mini\" version which was impossible to install on the PC and difficult to get it to work with the phone.)- I am a Samsung fan, but disappointed with their strategy on release of some of these phones and lack of support on the devices.UPDATES - Observations/Experience upto May 21, 2011.- Some signs of pixel inconsistencies.- Not as smooth and fast when video and multiple programs running. I recognize a slow down.- Software bugs as you use applications from the Android Market. (Similar issues as indentified with the old Android 2.2 operating system.)- There may be inaccuracies with the GPS. Satellite fix is slow.- Poor battery life.- Software glitches with the Android 2.2.- Slight lag when video and other programs on.- Lacking the full Android 2.3 experience.- GPS fixes may not be fully effective.- Hesitate on big files - need dual-core processor.- No crisp photo on front facing camera. Needs higher resolution.///////////////PS. Samsung's website rejected my reviews for mentioning other products. (Rejection notification received Saturday May 21, 2011.) I presume I should not have compared the Samsung Infuse to the Samsung GS2 released in Europe/Asia. Can anyone believe that? IT SEEMS SAMSUNG DOES NOT ALLOW DISSENT, EVEN FROM ITS LOYAL CUSTOMERS.

Once it does, I flick the switch and in a few minutes my phone is back to 80%+.  It charges very quickly.  Then, I go back to just the iPhone battery.There are three big issues that I see:1. If you need access to the iPhone's native port, then then case is tight and not too easy to slide out.2. When taking photos, there is a white haze when you use the flash.  You'll need to remove the case to use the flash (See item #1 issue)3. The orange stripe gets dirty.  You can wipe it clean, but it doesn't look like when you first got it.All in all, if you want some extra battery life while on the go and awesome protection, then get this.If you use your iPhone's flash a lot, or dock your iPhone, or always have dirty hands (no offense...but like mechanics, yard workers, etc.) then this is NOT for you.</td><td>List(1, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9671197964393735, 0.03288020356062647))</td><td>1.0</td><td>the phone didnt last for long, not even 6 months.The charger doesnt let it charge, i changed the charger thinking it is the charger but still nothing works.The phone just comes up shows that it is charging for a split second and then goes down and nothing happens.Totally a waste of money, even reg the phone features it is just a very basic phone so id suggest one can buy a cheaper phone.It was just used as my back-up for a week and once i needed it back after 6 months it never worked again.Wish I could return it.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7939699090300676, 0.20603009096993252))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I never even tried to see if it worked.

With LG scoring massive praise and high reviews, I finally thought I would jump in a deal offered by Newegg. I brought these headphones with me to the Philippines, after testing them for two weeks in Seattle with fairly decent results.At first the range was good with the headphones. I could leave my phone in one room and get up to fifteen feet away while receiving a good signal. Maybe eight feet with a wall between us. This was pretty good, the sound quality was great and noise isolation was acceptable.However, once I arrived in the Philippines I started having larger issues. My phone was unable to play to the headphones without skipping around a lot while I was exercising. Also, I found that the headset itself likes to jump around a lot, resulting in a bruised collar after about a mile of jogging nonstop. This was later partially solved by wearing a shirt with a smaller collar and placing the unit underneath, but I was still unable to listen to music without holding my phone in my hand within three feet of the unit.I became fed up with this after the third week that I've since thrown the headset into my luggage and refuse to acknowledge its pitiful existence. I've tried many things, from charging to testing from alternative sources and it has not given me the performance I was hoping for. And since I don't return back to the US until late April, I doubt I will be able to get a refund/claim on the item.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7820666648090332, 0.21793333519096686))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I love the concept, and it was very comfortable to wear, but no one could hear me speaking so I returned the item.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9908472324603589, 0.009152767539641078))</td><td>2.0</td><td>This headset frequently drops the bluetooth connection to my phone even when it is only a few feet away.

She is constantly complaining about catching her earphone cables on things as she works around the home so I thought this would be a nice gift. The first thing she said is that they were comfortable to wear and she really didn't even know she had them on.The sound out of them is pretty good and the dynamic range is not bad at all.  She uses them on her iPhone and iPad 2 to listen to music and audio books.  Now she can lay her phone or iPad 2 down in the kitchen and walk about 35 feet away in any direction with very good reception.  This includes shooting the Bluetooth signal through 2 walls.  At 40 to 45 feet the sound starts breaking up and at 45 feet it just loses connection.  As you walk back into range it immediately reconnects to the source.The headphones can connect to two devices but only one of them can be a phone.  Set it up with your phone first and then use the manual linking method to set it up with a playing device only, like an iPad.The earphones come with a recharger pack and they charged very quickly.  You can listen to music or talk on the phone 10 hours before needing to recharge.The headset has multiple buttons for your use while wearing the device.  There is an on/off switch, volume up/down rocker switch, a call switch that is used for connecting and disconnecting from calls and pairing the headset to your device and a microphone all located on the LH side. The call button also has a blue LED ring around it that is a solid blue when the headset is searching for a pairing device and it flashes blue when it is in normal operating mode.  While charging, the headset is off and the blue ring turns to red.  When the charger is connected the headset turns off regardless of what position the on/off switch is in. There is also a charging port on the inner side of the LH part of the headset.  On the RH side there is a Rew/FF button, and a play/pause button.  The earplugs magnetically fit into the headset when not in use.The LED ring around the call button can also help you to determine the amount of charge left in the headset.  If you press and hold the call button for 3 seconds the LED ring will light up for 1 second.  Solid blue means high charge, violet means medium charge and red means low charge.While playing music you can skip forward or back one song or chapter by quickly pressing the REW/FF rocker switch.  If you hold the switch you can speed forward or back as long as you hold the switch down.  You can answer a call, transfer a call, voice dial, recall the last number dialed, end a call, go to call waiting or reject a call all by using the call button.  Remember your phone device must be able to handle these types of actions for them to work.Our unit came with two different sets of ear buds that looked like medium and large.  Make sure that you use the set that best fits into your ear for comfort and also for good noise blocking.  It will also help you to get the best sound as most of the audio output will be directed into your ear and give you the best sound.  If they are too loose then part of the sound is lost and you will not get the best sound fidelity.The unit also features a bass boost that can be turned on.  If you press the up and down volume rocker switch on both sides for 1 second it will switch between normal EQ or Bass Boost.  You will hear a beep in the headset when the change is made.Cons:Some items on the device seem fragile as the headset is really a high tech miniature piece of electronics.  The flap that covers the charging port for example just seems excessively fragile.There is the geek effect in that you have this ring around your neck and there is a flashing blue light going when you have it turned on.  You forget you are wearing it but people do look at you sort of strangely.One thing that I did not like is that when we received the unit we noticed that the internal box that contained the headset had been opened before we got it.  The special sealing tape from the factory had been cut and the wall charger plastic bag had been opened.  In addition there was an empty bag for another set of ear buds.  When we purchased the unit it was supposed to be new and the fact that it was opened indicated that it had either been returned or opened in the warehouse.  I don't care for that as I paid for new merchandise but the unit has performed well so far.  I didn't deduct any stars for the opened box as it does not reflect on the product but it certainly does on the seller!Overall we like the headset and I would recommend it to you!</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9764553741602477, 0.023544625839752226))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I've tried so many Bluetooth Headsets in the last 2-3 years. These I just returned because I see the same thing happening. As with all of the others, they lose the connection thoughout the day. I'm sitting at a desk two feet from the laptop or tablet. And, I've had numerous laptops, tablets, phones etc. - same results - I don't get it. Windows or Mac or Android - or even Nokia - made no difference.I have to conclude Bluetooth is not ready for prime time. And, I will not buy another Bluetooth headset - nope not again. All I need is for the headset to maintain the connection so that I can make and receive skype calls throughout the day - that's it. I don't want to have to reconnect if someone calls or if I want to make a quick call. I don't get it - why can't this be accomplished.And, I really liked these. All the weight is in the part that rests - unnoticed - on your neck. And, when the ear buds fall out - as they inevitably do - they're right there a few inches from your ears so it's fast and easy to reinsert them.It's a brilliant design. And, when it was working - it worked very well. And, for music probably fine - good sound. Good range too.The magnet thing too is super clever. When the ear buds are not in your ears, they naturally get sucked into the ends via some magnets so they don't go flopping around. That's clever.Lastly, in terms of durability, I'm not sure these would have lasted all that long in my backpack anyway. They do seem a little fragile. I'm going to stick with my last set of BT - the Plantronics BackBeat 903+  They also lose connection all the time too but I didn't return those in time. And, they're more ruggedly built and smaller.But, I don't recommend those or any BT headset at this point.  I just bought theBose MIE2i Mobile Headset'wired' headset and I'm thrilled with those - never fall out of my ears - and never disconnect - with excellent sound.</td><td>List(2, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9144472711801205, 0.08555272881987956))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've had these headphones on my Wish List for some time and finally received them for Christmas this year, and let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There is a second, larger set included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, I returned this pair (HSB-700) for the similarly (and through some Amazon vendors, even more cheaply) priced Tone+ (HSB-730). I was stunned that the 700 does not include a microphone Mute function on the headset. There are a lot of very convenient control buttons, but found this to be an odd oversight. The HSB-730 includes a microphone mute, a vibration setting, and an increase to the already impressive battery life.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Good sound quality.+Great range.+Impressive battery life.+FANTASTIC VALUENEUTRAL:=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Surprising lack of a microphone mute feature.-Obsolete?

I usually use OB defenders. I was browsing around on Amazon, and came across this \"warehouse deal\" for the Survivor for $17 plus $5 and change for shipping & in the comments it said that it is in original packaging marked as 'used-like new condition.' Still the same 30 day return policy applied, so i fig'd why not? I rec'd the item within 2 days, ordered it Sunday & had it by Tues afternoon. The item was in the original packaging sealed - it doesnt even look like anyone had this item previously & returned it. (btw if you purch this case at full price its anywhere from $40-$50.)Anyway, this is a very rugged case - it feels better than the defenders IMO. I think its about the same size, maybe a teeny bit bigger but not by much at all. ALL ports on this case have a little door flap to close them off, and in addition to that - the built-in screen protector also covers not just the screen, but the ear piece that you hear through as well. So far i've taken a couple of calls & it doesnt interfere with the sound or proximity sensor on the 4S. All ports are easily accessible - the only one that is kinda bugging me right now is the flap that covers the camera. I've heard of alot of people just cut that one off, but i dont think i'll do that myself. It protects the lens of the camera & i dont use my camera excessively. As for the belt clip that comes with it - i never use them so i can't comment on that. I can say just looking at it, that it seems kinda flimsy - in this aspect i'd say OB does their belt clip for the defender better.Overall, right now i feel this case is better protection than the OB defender is & i really like it - especially the pink/white!! I would definately recommend this case to someone looking for great protection.  Hopefully it holds up just as good as it looks :)</td><td>List(2, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9217493796171037, 0.07825062038289644))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have loved HTC phones. I've owned the PPC-6700, PPC-6800, Touch Pro, Touch Pro 2 and Evo 4G and mostly delighted in each and every one of them, shortcomings and all. But the Evo 3D has left me wanting to the point that I am returning it and trying another brand.Please understand that this is MY review and my sujective impressions. Others may justifiably consider what I view as shortcomings as trivial concerns. So be it.On the plus side, the build quality is typical HTC: solid. I've never had an HTC unit that lost pieces or started splitting at the seams. Treat the Evo 3D with respect and it should last longer than you own the phone.The quality of the qVGA screen is excellent. No, it doesn't perform well in bright sunlight, but virtually nothing else does either. Everywhere else, the screen is splendid. The higher resolution, however, comes with some drawbacks for me. The Swype keyboard is more difficult to use because the keycaps appear smaller. I'm pretty proficient with Swype on my Evo 4G, but suddenly I am all thumbs, so to speak.It would be nice if the Swype folks made it possible to somehow scale the keyboard display, but I suspect that may remain an unfulfilled wish. Instead, I will have to practice, practice and practice.The dual-core processor is snappy, there is plenty of user accessible memory. The form is nice: slimmer than the Evo 4G.There's also a separate camera button, a piece of sensibility many manufacturers are coming back to.The 3D photo and video capability does nothing for me. Some people may love it: does nothing for me one way or the other. Took some photos and video to play with it and was not impressed with the depth of the 3D effect. Again, subjective response - your experience may vary.Including the 3D cameras, though, led to HTC including only 5 Megapixel cameras. In 2D mode, I think they are inferior to the 8MP camera on the Evo 3D. Also, the kickstand that appeared on the Evo 3D is gone and that I consider to be a major omission. The kickstand was very, very handy and I didn't realize how much I used it until going without it.Next on my short list of Evo 3D shortcomings is the audio. I find it entirely inadequate. The Evo 4G was loud: the 3D - at least my Evo 3D - is not. Headphone volume is lousy. Speakerphone volume is lousy. The audio is lousy. Period.Next to last on my list is touch screen sensitivity. Like I said, I've owned a number of HTC phones and they all were basically fine, but the Evo 3D - and I hold open the possibility that it could just be my unit - isn't up to snuff. There are portions of the screen that sometimes seem as if they are dead.Finally is the USB port placement: HTC put the USB port on the side of the Evo 3D which drives me nuts. I usually put the phone on a charge cable in the car. Try picking it up with a USB cable coming out the side. It is not, in my opinion, convenient and I just don't like it.So, is the Evo 3D a bad phone? No. There are just some things about it that I don't like and they are serious enough in my mind to cause me to return the Evo 3D and get another new model. Would another person be likely to say I'm all wet and that what appear to be shortcomings to me aren't even minor annoyances to them? Yes.The Evo 3D merits a look, but make sure it really fits your requirements.Jerry</td><td>List(3, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9937269169688961, 0.006273083031103845))</td><td>3.0</td><td>I initially reviewed these batteries as a 5 star but now just a month later I have a battery that is completely dead.... chargers don't even see the battery.  I understand that these things happen but I found the failure just a few days after my 30-day return window with Amazon and I have not been able to find anywhere that I can contact Hyperion so I essentially wasted money.  I would highly recommend the Anker brand batteries (Anker 2 x 1800mAh Li-ion Batteries for Samsung + Charger) over these as you are able to contact them and they are very helpful.  These batteries may be just as good but having a failure this soon and no way to contact Hyperion makes this brand a worse option.UPDATE: The seller (who is also the maker) read my reviews and responded to me and replaced the faulty battery easily with no work on my part.  I've upgraded this product to 3 stars because everything is functional and it does seem like the maker is willing to help and make things right but without a company website and contact information you might want to take that into consideration.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9991613192044061, 8.386807955938433E-4))</td><td>4.0</td><td>This was a real bear to set up. There is apparently an entirely separate technical support group that covers this product, but they are pretty knowledgeable and helpful. This is not a plug and play device--it is necessary to call Verizon to have them register this on your account.Also, there is a list of routers that are not compatible with this network extender. My router (Linksys WRT54G) is on the list so I had to use a different router. That was annoying, but I had a different router lying around so not a huge deal. The list is not published anywhere but Verizon tech support will give you a list of routers with known issues.Second, it's important to note that the NE has to be placed near a window so that it can get GPS signal. I had to run a 100' ethernet cable from my router to the window where the NE is placed. It was a nuisance, but there was no other option.There is no web interface for the NE, and the only indication of status is four status lights that change color and blink patterns. After plugging in the NE, it sat with a slow red blinking system light (indicating a problem) for several days. I didn't have time to troubleshoot it and just let it sit, thinking I would look into it later and return the device if I couldn't get it working. When I finally had some time to troubleshoot, I found that the NE had synched up with the network and was connected. I hadn't done anything to it, so maybe it just took a long time to go through whatever startup steps it was doing.Since that time, the connection has been solid and I have stopped missing phone calls when at home. I'm able to initiate a phone call at home and have it automatically transfer to a cell tower uninterrupted when I leave home. Phone calls won't transfer from a cell tower to the NE, so I don't expect that but it's not an issue.The tech service folks did say that this is an older version of the device so it doesn't support data. I have wireless at home and I'm not going to be using my phone for much data at home anyway, so that's also not an issue. The newer version that supports data is significantly more expensive.One final thing that a new user will want to do is to log into the Verizon website and set up the network extender so that your phone number is prioritized above all others. Up to 50 phone numbers can be entered on the priority list. There's no way to prevent other users from connecting through the network extender, but voice requires pretty low bandwidth and as long as I can always get a connection for my phone then I'm okay with that. Tech support can walk you through this setup.All things considered I would buy this device again because it has solved the poor reception problem I had at home.  Some other reviews mentioned that this was a refurb/repackaged product. That did not appear to be the case--mine was new and had never been used.</td><td>List(1, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9727992599655515, 0.027200740034448508))</td><td>2.0</td><td>The device works well but it is necessary to activate it thru Verizon to be able to manage the cell phone numbers it works with. When I called Verizon I was told that it was activated to another customer. Most likely the seller sent me a device which someone else had returned. I am gong to have to return it and purchase another.Other than for this problem, the device does appear to work well, providing a much stronger cell signal in my home.Update: Amazon did email a return label with free shipping. I subsequently found that this is not the same device currently being sold by Verizon. Both being an older model (which doesn't handle 3G) and being a returned item explain why this is less expensive than buying thru Verizon.If you don't need to improve your 3G signal and you don't have any other houses near you, this would be a good buy. However if you have neighbors you run the risk the risk that you won't be able to use the stronger signal if a few neighbors are using their cell phones. Registration thru Verizon is necessary in order to ensure that the phone numbers you choose will have priority.</td><td>List(3, 5)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.951541184911087, 0.04845881508891295))</td><td>2.0</td><td>Unfortunately I have to include as part of my review that I can't return or exchange this easily, and I didn't even know I was buying this from some reseller I thought I was buying this directly from Moshi via Amazon.I had this long review, I'll shorten it, I'm shocked, Moshi makes good stuff I thought, unless this is a knock off.

While I use my finger much of the time, I don't want to when I'm eating, just put hand lotion on, etc.The amCase (TM) Ultra-sensitive 2-in-1 Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad, iphone was the second stylus I bought for my Evo 3D. After a disappointing experience with the first stylus I bought, I was hoping for a better experience with a higher priced stylus.I wasn't disappointed in the way the amCase Ultra-sensitive stylus wrote on my capacitive touch screen. The experience was very smooth, very responsive. I have absolutely no complaints regarding the way the stylus works with my Evo 3D.To add even more functionality, the amCase stylus is a regular pen on the other end, making it very useful for moments when you actually have to write on real paper. The pen function writes well, although it isn't the best pen I've every used. That really wasn't quite as important to me as long as it wrote well and gave me the versatility of a combination pen/stylus.It also has a clip on the side that holds the stylus very securely on shirts, purse pocket, etc. I kept it clipped to the POUCH that I bought for my Evo 3D so it was always handy when I wanted it.Where the amCase stylus failed me is in the design. It is comfortable enough to hold and use, but the major flaw in its design lies in the screw mechanism that opens the pen and allows the pen to be refilled. Within a week, this screw came undone and the half with the stylus tip fell off. Of course this couldn't happen in my purse or in my house, but in a store. I didn't notice until I got home and went to put my phone on the charger.I struggled with how to rate this. The stylus and pen work well enough that I can't rate it with one star, although the ease with which the stylus falls apart and is lost is a complete design failure. I can't in good conscience give it more than two stars, and I feel generous in doing that. With an original price point of about $25, this stylus should have a better, more reliable design. As it is, I wouldn't recommend it even at the much lower sale price it is currently sold at.As an alternative, I prefer the styluses below. Neither has a pen function, only a stylus, but they work well, are reasonably priced, and have a much more reliable design.*3M Smart Pen - Grey Clip-On Design - Precision Touch Pen for Mobile Handheld Devices*3 Pack of Universal Touch Screen Stylus Pen (Red + Black + Silver)**UPDATE ADDED 09/10/11**After I posted the review above, I was contacted by AM Express, who said they believed I had received a defective model and asked that I verify my shipping address so they could send a replacement. Within a few days of receiving the replacement, I tucked it in my jeans pocket thinking I'd be using it when I reached my destination but it fell out of my pocket and was lost. I had not used the clip to attach it to my jeans, merely slipped it inside my pocket, so this was not the fault of the design, just bad luck. Unfortunately, I didn't have the second stylus long enough to determine if it was indeed better than the first one I wrote about in my review above.So, I ordered a third amCase stylus. I truly hoped that the first one I received was merely defective and that I would have a better experience with the next one. The third one arrived already broken. I had it shipped to my office, opened it downstairs in the receiving area, and found the problem before I even made it back upstairs to my desk. The end with the silver tip that is attached to the shirt clip was broken and wobbly, making the shirt clip unreliable. When I returned to my desk, I filled out an RMA with Amazon and sent it back the next day for a refund.It was nice of AM Express to send the replacement stylus, although I think their gesture was motivated by their desire to have me replace this review with a positive one and was not necessarily born out of good customer service. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I've received several emails from them asking that I update my review. So, here it is. I've had three of these styluses and two of them were broken and the third lost within days so I couldn't determine whether it was better or not. Seriously, though, what are the chances that one customer would receive two defective units unless there is a problem with the design or manufacturing of these styluses?</td><td>List(24, 27)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8152030482379446, 0.18479695176205527))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I used mine for one evening and it worked great, loved not having any finger prints, the next day it quit responding, have to push really hard to get it to work.

I can use the earpiece to make or receive a call, talk for a few minutes, hang up... and then it's gone!  After just five or ten minutes, if I get another call or go to make another, the earpiece is disconnected.  It still shows up on the phone as being paired, but I get no audio on the earpiece.  I have to unpair it, or turn it off and back on, for it to reconnect!I've gone back to disable and then reconnect the earpiece a couple of times, following the instructions, but I still get the same performance.

If only the dang thing didn't have a problem with randomly rebooting in the middle of calls, I would have kept it.This Samsung has just about the harshest robotic female (?) voice I've ever heard come out of any kind of device.  It sounds like it's shouting at me:  \"POWER! ON!\"  \" POWER! OFF!\"  \"DEVICE! CONNECTED!\"  And no more sweet little voice telling me I have just ten minutes of talk time remaining, like on the Jawbone... oh well.I really wish I could return this.

The cover feels like it is plastic covered cardboard and very cheaply made, and feels like it wouldn'lt last more than a few uses before the thin cover band breaks. I bought this case because I wanted a rotating case. It was to replace my non-rotating case which is still in great condition after months of use.

I am not sure if I will be using this as a hands-free device (for which it was intended) because AAA says talking on a cell phone while driving is akin to driving drunk (still distracting).  Hawaii recently instituted a hands-free law, so that is the only way to legally use a phone while driving (and many other states have similar laws).  If I were to use a hands-free device I find this preferable to wearing a head set.Because I am more likely to use it to listen to music I first tried pairing it with my Archos tablets Archos 70 - 8 GB Internet Tablet (Black) and Archos 5 500 GB Internet Tablet with Android.  All it took to pair those devices was making them discoverable and in a couple of seconds each of them paired.  I was able to listen to music both from the music/ media player and from videos.  I imagine that if I wanted to use the gps with it, it would work with that as well (since it is a native ap).  I personally do not like GPS systems... find them a huge distraction, and so did not test it as I will not be using it that way.Then I tried to set up my cell phone, a particularly persnickety device, the LG620g.  I have had some difficulty pairing this phone with other devices (maybe yethering was disabled and effected other devices?).  In any event I did not have any difficulty with the Jabra speaker.  It took 2 attempts, but following the instructions (holding the answer phone button while turning on) for secondary pairing, it was immediately recognized.Likely as not my primary use will be listening to music stored on my Archos tablets.  While the speaker is not audiophile quality, it is not bad at all, and bests the sound quality using a transmitter. One of these days I will try pairing it with my netbook, as we needed to use subtitles to watch a movie on a recent trip, and I have little doubt that the sound quality and volume from this speaker is better than that on my netbook.  However that is a tertiary use.I am very happy with the build quality, sound quality, ease of use, and clarity if instruction! (there are several devices I purchased recnetly where I was instructed to go online for information which should have been in a manual).  jabra included one (in English, French & Spanish).  It comes with a 1 year warranty, which is longer than most devices now ship with.

The packaging was nice and there were many little pieces for your ear for custom fitting.I fully charged my device and tried it out.It synced with my iPhone 4S first time around. However later when I tried to sync it would not sync, I spent about 15 minutes trying to sync and no luck, deleted the pairing info and tried it from scratch still no luck.I tried it again later and it finally paired. Once paired it worked ok as long as my phone was very close by, even 10 feet away I would lose signal.The headphone are not bad once I got it to fit into my ear, but it is bit awkward, there are options to make it fit more secure with the add on and it helps a lot but if you look in the mirror it looks strange.It is kinda like wearing two bluetooth headset , while it is smaller then the normal bluetooth set, it still looks kinda dorky.The cord that connects together is little stiff, it doesn't fall on your back so it kinda hangs in the air unless you put it under your shirt.The sound is ok, volume is not as loud as it can be but for bluetooth I would be satisfied for it.I ended up returning this device and buying the LG because it simply would not pair with my iPhone and the effort was just too much. Maybe I got a lemon because there are others who love it, but for $60 the LG pairs effortlessly and I can control the volume easy, skip music, pause/resume, take phone calls and it works great with Siri.I gave it 2 stars because of problem with pairing, otherwise I would have probably kept it and gave it a 3 stars.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6889982059317646, 0.31100179406823536))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I tried several other brands of bluetooth headphones before these and each one got returned because they simply didn't work well.  These are the only ones I'v tried that I would recommend.  They are easy to pair.  The playback controls (volume, skipping, pause/play) are easy to use.  They are comfortable and most importantly they stay in place when working out.  I bike 20+ miles per day and work up a good sweat doing so, other headphones would start to slip off, but these stay right where I put them.  There are 3 sizes of ear buds and 2 different accessories to keep them in place (one over the ear, which I prefer, and one in the ear (also in 3 sizes) which also worked well).  The sound quality is excellent.  The only negative thing I would add is that the bluetooth technology causes them to cut out occassionally.  I've had this problem with every bluetooth device, so it's hard to hold it against Jaybird, but the package insert says they should work up to 10 meters in doors; in my expereiance, they have trouble working at 10 feet.  I usually workout with my iPhone in an armband which is recommended for outdoor use, but really seems to be necessary for indoor use as well.  If you put your device down and turn away from it with these on, the sound will cut out.  This is really a limitation of Bluetooth technology more than it is a flaw in the device.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5616855991807375, 0.4383144008192626))</td><td>4.0</td><td>it looked like it would be a great case for the phone i got but sadly i have to return it due it is too small for the phone i ordered which is the Motorola Atrix 2 MB865, i emailed the seller and they are giving me a refund.. should they have a case for the phone i got and i like it then i will get one.. good job MINITURTLE on your customer service!! for those who have a Motorola Atrix 46 MB860 then its a great but for you</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9490112117745597, 0.050988788225440326))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I have Samsung Galaxy S3 and I have been using this cable for about two months.

The Camera on the Triumph is a 5mp one but the quality wasn't as great as it could have been. I can also record in 720p which i liked, the playback was a little laggy but that might have been because of the slow memory card preinstalled with the phone.

Battery life so far has not been as good as I hoped it would be but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be.

I am confident it was a faulty device (let's hope), so I will update my review once I have tested the 2nd one when it comes in.Update (Long Overdue):I did eventually receive a second headset from a different supplier. Unfortunately upon opening the packaging I noticed the headset did not look new - which is was marked as. It came in a very generic box, but after checking with Motorola, they said there was no packaging like that - not even OEM. So at that point I just got fed up with my experience trying to get this headset and did not even test the USED one. I just returned it and went to a store to buy one. However, they did not carry this headset, so I ended up with a Plantronics 165 which I have been using for several months now and really enjoy.

Honestly, after using a bluetooth headset while working out in the summer of 2012 I could never go back to using a corded device.Running is easier because there's no flopping cord and you don't have to route it anywhere.  Lifting is more fluid because you have a greater range of motion without a cord, and the cord won't get pressed against your body in an awkward way if you are bench pressing or squatting.  The list goes on and on.However, there are some noticeable downsides.- The sound quality is below that of a corded device, like the Apple Earbuds or something more advanced like a Shure setup.  But you're trading sound quality for ease of use and sport-specific benefits, so this shouldn't be an issue for most people.- The battery is punny.  When you first open your headset and use it you'll probably have a decent battery life, but after 3-6 months of using mine (the third one I got after warrantying the first two - more on that later...) the device will only last for a 30-minute run, and sometimes not even!  This is by far the biggest issue for me.- The fit isn't great.  The earpieces fall out of my ears and the included tips don't make it any better.  It's annoying when I'm running fast into the wind, or biking, and the music is overridden by a big whoosh!  They've never fallen off me while exercising, however, so at least there is that.I would recommend buying this product if you can't find anything else.

I had lots of time just sitting around waiting on a flight or a bus, and I kept my smartphone charged up by connecting it to this charger.  Times when I had an outlet available I charged the anker and other times when I had no access to power, this was my go to.  The BEST thing I love about this charger is the size.  I kept it in my rear pocket, hooked up via a retractable cable to my phone which I kept holstered to my belt, so everything was secured on my person when I was charging my phone.  Sometimes, I talked on the phone while it was charging and it never got in my way.I also own a couple of New Trent battery chargers, and I use those to mainly charge up my PC Tablets while traveling.  Those are really great chargers too, but I have the 9900 and the 11000 mah models that are larger than this anker, but they all serve a purpose.  So, if you're looking for a nice simple charger that will fit easily in your pocket or purse, and you only need it for recharging a cell, then this is worth looking into.UPDATE: JUNE 2013 -  I've been traveling in Europe since May, and have used this charger daily to keep my camera, cell phone and kindle charged. I have 2 so when one is charging I can easily use the other. I definetly recommend buying at least one, but having 2 if you're traveling. My original one was purchased in Mar 2012, and still going strong. Thanks to distributor and amazon for selling these at such a bargain price!UPDATE: OCTOBER 2013  -  I just returned from my European trip, and these chargers were a lifesaver. I would be sightseeing all day recharging my camera's battery and phone battery on just one of these chargers. Then when I returned to my accommodations I would use my 2nd one while I charged the one I used all day. I used it while charging my phone and on the net via WiFi for hours on a layover. All airports don't have convenient charging stations or outlets.

Service heard it did not work they quickly sent me another one, no charge, no return needed.What I have discovered relative to the Transformer is that this 12v/usb adapter is rated at 2 amps. Car cigarette lighters are typically fused at 5 amps or higher so they work fine with this. However, if you try to charge the Transformer via a AC/cigarette lighter adapter (with this 12v/usb adapter plugged into it) make sure it is rated at least 2 amps (which most are not). The transformer must be calling for more than 1 amp.Even with this in consideration, the first 12v/usb adapter they sent did not work.</td><td>List(3, 4)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.14668998574694248, 0.8533100142530575))</td><td>1.0</td><td>ordered 3 pairs of these. 2 of them only sounded out of one ear, and they all came in plastic bags with only one set of ear canal spacers.

I always use my Casemate kickstand case and I don't have time to take it off when I get in the car. I'll have to look around for more universal mounts after my last one failed due to poor build quality.There was very little information on the box (especially nothing saying that cases were not supported) and at the TMO store the box was locked into a rack so viewing it was quite a challenge.

Yes, the material is of cheap plastic but if your like me who wants decent lows and mids (mainly for dance/electronic music) and want the freedom of wires these are for you.  I only need them to go do my laundry and wear around the house while ironing.  For driving I use my Apple mic/earbuds.  If you're looking for bluetooth headphones get these.  This is my first bluetooth product and I couldn't be happier.  I made one phone call and the sound quality was expected-okay to say the least.  The microphone is pretty far from your mouth so if you whisper or if you tend to mumble or speak in a low voice that might be an issue but speak up, after all, you got some cool wireless headphones.  They do kind of look like that princess reviewers are talking about but who cares.  And as for the blue light, it may be annoying(for me it isn't) but i recommend getting a black marker and black that ish out if it bothers you!  Try these out if your skeptical.

I noticed some reviewers are reporting that the case is slippery. I can only assume they received a different case than I did. This case is simply not slippery, I mean it can sit on the dash of a car and not slide around. I have devised a test to demonstrate this level of grip. I will post a picture of it sitting on a piece of paper at an angle to see how steep of an angle is required before it starts to slip. I imagine it is more than 45 degrees. For the price, I can't recommend this case enough.I am reviewing this case as I bought it. It paid $3.99 for the black version.This case is somewhere between a silicone case and an Otterbox, while being cheaper than both of them in some cases. This case has a relatively grippy (not sticky) inner silicone shell. On top of that, you get a rubberized plastic piece that covers the corners, sides and back of the phone.Around the screen, the case has a raised edge. This way your screen can't make contact with a surface if you set your phone face down. The back is soft touch covered plastic and feels very high quality. It is just the right balance of grip and slip. I need it to slip into my pocket, and I don't want lint from my pocket sticking to it. With silicone cases, it is hard to get the phone in my pocket because they're almost sticky. They also attract lint which is annoying. This case won't slip out of your hand, but it isn't as sticky as silicone. It also covers the camera nicely, so it doesn't touch the table when you set it down screen up.With the soft touch plastic covering the corners and a layer of silicone to absorb shocks, I can confirm that this case can easily handle drops from chest height (4-6) feet. I wouldn't see how high it can go, but it definitely protects your device from accidental drops. The silicone case also slightly covers the edge of the phone screen bezel, so no dirt gets in between the phone and the case. It also helps protect the screen because even gorilla glass breaks easily if you hit it on the edge. With this case, it is covered. The buttons and everything work just fine. My normal power plug and headphones work great too.For anyone who doesn't want the bulk of an Otterbox, but still wants some good drop protection, this is a great case to consider. It also costs a fraction of the Otterboxes for the Galaxy 3. For $3.99, It's a case everyone should have. I had this in my cart for a long time, and it used to cost $15. I thought I'd wait and see if the price would go down, and now I got it for $3.99. For those familiar with Otterbox, this case is of equal build quality. The protection is reversed though. The hard plastic shell goes around a shock absorbing silicone layer.I highly recommend this to all my friends. Two of them bought a case as soon as they heard the price. I missed that soft touch material featured on droids. Now, I can have it again for under $4! If you're even considering it, just buy it. Amazon's return policy is ace, so you can always return it if you don't like it. Seeing it in person, it's hard to imagine that it cost $4. It is a great case for an unbelievable price.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.999058095355355, 9.41904644645001E-4))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I didn't want to give this product a one star rating but was given no alternative course of action by amazon.After just 4 days of use, the white finish started to wear off on the back near the logo.I thought that this is a good product and I just happened to receive a defective one, however I've since done a more thorough search of the reviews and found a few others who mention the same problem.Normally, I would contact the seller and give them the opportunity to make it right.

I used the Astro mini to recharge my completely discharged 0% Anker battery in my Galaxy S4.Testing:After extensive testing, I have determined that the Astro Mini provides roughly 1900mAh or 73% of a charge that makes it to the battery in the GS4. Anker states in the manual that 30% of the battery capacity is lost to heat and voltage conversion...which would effectively make the battery 2100mAh. I found this to be relatively accurate, given the fact that the GS4 can also lose some of the charge capacity through heat dissipation. It's within the realm of possibility that the GS4 wastes another 200mAh of capacity in the charging process.My Verdict:The Astro Mini is GREAT for use as an emergency backup battery! It consistently provides a 73% charge to my GS4. At $22 on Amazon, it's a great value as a quality external battery. It also comes with a short micro usb cable, a micro usb to Apple (up to 4S) adapter, and a quality bag to carry it all in. For my purposes, I choose to carry a backup battery in my pocket at all times. However, this external battery has come in quite handy on the few days at the hospital that I depleted both batteries and fits perfectly in my pocket in addition to my spare battery.As a side note, I'd HIGHLY suggest that you purchase Anker replacement batteries for your GS4, as I did, as they most certainly outperform the Samsung factory batteries. NFC is fully functional with these replacement batteries as well.Anker 2600mAh Li-Ion Battery[...]I also purchased the Anker 18W car charger for my vehicle and it seems to perform far superior to any car charger that I've had before.

To release just push the button and the arms come apart to let your phone go. The flashing led on phone call is a neat little gimmick however that will be staying off in my case. The biggest complaint I have about this item and I'm not sure if it was just a manufacturer defect in the one I got is the phone mount swivel was not notched correctly.

The sound quality is excellent, both listening and speaking.  The voice recognition allows a call to be answered or ignored without touching a button on the headset.  At first, it worked perfectly right out of the box, pairing with an Evo by HTC.  Up to this point, I would completely recommend the Elite.The problem I encountered was with the headset suddenly dying, as if completely out of power.  My phone could not recognize it when searching for Bluetooth devices.  I charged it up for around ten hours, but it still would not display a full charge.  Fortunately, it was still able to pair with the phone the next morning for around ten minutes, and then died again.Mine may just be a defective unit.

I heard a lot of good things about this case, so I decided to give it a try. I mean why not 14$ is a good price for a quality iPhone case. For the most part the the case was everything I hoped it would be, It had good looks(I had the blue and white version) very good protection for a slimmer type of case, with all the buttons covered and a good lay on the table design so the screen will stay protected if put on a table or counter face down. The only thing I didn't like was that the camera cut out  much bigger than it needed to be in my opinion, making it much easier for dirt and dust to gather in there. Aside from that one minor gripe I had, the Belkin Essentials was a nearly perfect case, so much so that my cousin asked me to buy one for him. The second time around though I noticed another small problem with the case, the sleep/wake button was just to sensitive, putting any pressure anywhere around the button would usually cause a unintended click which was not present on the first case. After using both cases I believe that I just received a case with a small defect the 2nd time around and would have no worries about buying this case again in the future.

I am in field where I get a lot of calls and it is imperative that I have a good connection and can hear my clients clearly.  I decided to buy several different model bluetooth sets and compare them side by side since they all have at least a 30 day return policy.  First I bought a motorola, waste of money, disconnected and unpaired constantly.  Second I moved up to the jawbone Icon.  fair volume, super uncomfortable and without the hook that was unbendable and caused blisters, it would fall out of your ear just by chewing.. I did like the features, especially caller ID and voice dial.  But after several drops out of my ear the sound quality was gone and I returned that one too.  Next I tried the Plantonics Voyager HD (top of the line)  and was NOT impressed.  The volume was insufficent and in a noisy enviornment, even at full volume (30) it was difficult to hear.  I also didnt like the fact that you had to pay extra for voice control service...and although they give you a free 1 year subscription to their vocalyst program, after one year you have to pay for an ongoing subscription, which is pure greed and unacceptable, the same service is totally free on the  jawbone Icon and Jabra Supreme, ...and lastly, the Voyager  did not even support caller ID, and for such a pricey bluetooth, that was the clincher for me.  Returned that one too.  Decided on the Jabra Supreme. I was nervous about it due to the reviews that it was bulky and wouldnt stay in the ear, like the Jawbone Icon.  But I went ahead and took a chance.  Turns out this is far and away the best of them all.  With the extra earpad that comes with it hooks inside your ear and combined with the soft bendable hook it is totally secure and I felt it was as secure as the Plantronics voyager.  The volume is superb.  In fact, at half way up its louder than the plantronics at full blast.  The sound quality is the best by  light years. (compares to a corded phone)  When I would voice text with the Voyager, I had to constantly repeat myself to get it right, with the Supreme....perfect voice texting it hears you clearly.  All the voice commands work perfectly.  The only complaint is the unit is big and thus not too stylish, but it more than makes up for it in incredible performance. My phone is an HTC Radar windows based phone. The Jabra Supreme is the one I am keeping.</td><td>List(99, 100)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9848719867179119, 0.015128013282088255))</td><td>1.0</td><td>Purchased this for a great price, didn't really like the look, but though hey great price.

I had had a very early Droid and I liked its flexibility and ability to be configured more easily than the iPhone. I also never liked my iPhone's virtual keyboard for texting. With those things in mind I looked into recommendations of consumer magazines and bought the Samsung Stratosphere, which came from Verizon with a 14 day trial period.The phone has good and bad points like almost every electronic device. The interface is generally good, though it is now harder to tailor than earlier Androids in my opinion (some things are seemingly impossible to get rid of; a trait of iPhones too.) The display is gorgeous, and I found the camera and video to be good. I thought the Internet interface worked great, and call quality and clarity were both good. I also like the flexibility that the SD card provides. The physical keyboard is a very nice feature (and was the primary driver of my selection of the Stratosphere,) and though it's not as comfortable to use as an older LG I had, it's satisfactory. The balance of the phone with the keyboard extended is awkward however, and the physical requirements of the keyboard make the phone notably thicker and heavier than the competition (especially when compared to the new iPhone 5.) The battery life is nothing to write home about; you might want to pack a spare battery if you travel and are a heavy cellphone user. For me the biggest single negative was the contour of the phone itself: it is very curved and has highly profiled edges making it easy (very easy) to drop, though some cases may help this. I dropped my Stratosphere more times in the first week I had it than I dropped my iPhone in over two years.Ultimately after using the Stratosphere for ten days I reevaluated it and decided I wasn't going to be happy with it for a two year contract duration and did something I didn't think I would do: I returned the Stratosphere, paid the restocking fee, and got a new iPhone 5. Though I don't love the iPhone 5 (though I like it better than the 4,) I do prefer it to the Stratosphere overall (though call clarity is worse on the iPhone) due to it being so much thinner and lighter. I miss the physical keyboard, but I don't regret making the swap.The bottom line is this: if you want a Droid and you want a physical keyboard, this is a very good choice, just realize it's noticeably heavier and clumsier to handle than some of the competition.</td><td>List(1, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7452361370818951, 0.2547638629181049))</td><td>5.0</td><td>I really like the ZAGG screen protectors for my phones, and I've used them for years.

We have had a lot of problems with my wife's phone and its replacement.  Read on if you like to hear of my experiences with Apple customer service.My wife purchased this phone and it worked okay until I installed a wireless system in my home.  My Galaxy III had no problems finding the network (nor any problems, I highly recommend it), nor did any of my computers.  However, her phone would not see the network.  We chatted with Apple support numerous times to no avail.  Finally, they said they would send a placement phone, a refurbished one (Beware of such phones).  Also, I had to guarantee we would return the old phone with a $450 charge to my credit card.The refurbished phone finally arrived and on the third day it would not power on.  However, when placed on a charger it would work but would not charge past 30%.  Again, after several phones calls they decided that this phone was defective.  The tech person said he would have a brand new phone sent and seem surprised that I was not excited over this.  The original phone was less than 9 months old.  However, he could not authorize this and I would have to wait another day for another person to phone to set up the delivery.This person phoned the next day and also seemed surprised that I was not delighted in the fact they would be sending me a new phone.  She explained in 4 to 5 days I would receive the new phone and would again charge my credit card until they received the old phone.  When I complained about some compensation for my trouble with their defective products she seemed surprised that anyone would ask such a thing of Apple.  She made a vague offer of some inexpensive accessory.So we are currently without a phone unless it is plugged into a charger.BTW, from my recent experience you will find all of the Apple people rather sickening in their \"sweetness\" and use of phases like \"have a perfect day\" or \"that is just perfect of you\".</td><td>List(2, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.17849299221768544, 0.8215070077823146))</td><td>5.0</td><td>But I returned for a Life Proof as my son fishes and we needed waterproof.

But trust me, this is a superb Android-based smartphone. The HTC Sense overlay isn't terrible, has some nice additions to Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread), and in 4 weeks of use and testing I've found it hardly wanting. Battery life can be short, but getting additional chargers and cords will help, as will using Juice Defender or Llama to program in some power savings. HTC offers many widgets including a cute but simplistic Battery widget for your home screen which displays charge and status. If you've never used HTC Sense or the HTC widgets, they are both beautiful and feature some functionality that third party apps (for $) on the Android Market offer. I recommend Battery Monitor Widget and SystemPanel Pro if you really want to see where your power is going.One thing I want to point out is that the \"What's in the box\" description on Amazon is wrong, this phone does NOT come with a wired, stereo earbud set. T-mobile store personnel confirmed for me that their package includes no headset. No loss, the HTC charging cable is crap, has a problematic micro-usb plug, I suggest stashing it for travel in favor of anAmazonBasics USB Cable - 2.0 A Male to Micro B (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters)which I'll review shortly. I wouldn't expect the HTC headset to be any good. I recommend you instead shop for something like aJLab J3M In-Ear EarphonesorJBuds J5M In-Ear Earphones(both have microphone and control button). Bose in-ear headphones are great, I own a pair, but they're overpriced.Etymotic, Shure, and even Monster make some respectable earbuds that have fans.Also missing from the box: micro-SDHC memory card for the expansion slot, which the camera app and music apps really need. But this allows you to buy, according to your budget, a 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, or even a 32GB card. I recommend aKingston 32GB microSDHC Class 4 cardor similar. I had aKingston 4 GB microSDHC Class 4 CardI was using in my PlayStation that tests at some phenomenal speeds, at the sacrifice of storage space for music and HD video. Shop around on Amazon, usually a Kingston or Sandisk package with a USB reader, or SD and mini-SD adapters, can be found for not much more than a dollar per gigabyte. (Lexars, with higher speed ratings, will cost more.) I like Kingston memory, never had a problem with cards, laptop SIMMs, etc; Sandisk cards, though ubiquitous, have been getting a flurry of online discussion about their Class 4 cards (guaranteed 4MB/s sequential write speed) far surpassing those ratings. PNY and other brands, meh I avoid them unless they're disposable. I ended up getting aSanDisk 16GB Mobile ULTRA (SDSDQY-016G-A11A)with a rebate at Costco, not as fast as the Kingston 4GB card, but a good performer.Pros:+ Great, high resolution 4.3\" screen for crisper text and graphics, at this time only the Verizon Rezound variant of this phone has a better resolution (even better than iPhone 4S, I'm told)+ 1.5Ghz dual-core Snapdragon processor+ Solid construction and build quality that is immediately evident out of the box+ Expandable memory to suit your usage and needs, in addition to the ~9GB of internal storage available to the user.+ Dedicated buttons for camera and videocam+ T-Mobile now offers WiFi calling (December update)+ HTC Sense, great launcher, some cool widgets, and not much cruft-ware bloating the phone+ Can I mention again how NICE this phone looks and feels in your hand?Minuses:- Battery life, you'll need to charge nightly unless you conserve aggressively (there are multiple methods to do this, some involving 3rd party apps)- Colleagues noticed the phone is heavier than comparable phones, due partly to that great build quality; I don't mind this personally- Pricey, at the time of my purchase (second week of December) more than aSamsung Galaxy S II 4G Android Phone (T-Mobile)or other comparable models (the SGS2 was $130 on T-Mobile, the Amaze was anywhere from $180 to $230 depending upon rebates and purchasing method, i.e. online, store, reseller)- It is missing some things you'll end up buying -- plan to spend another fifty dollars on acar charger, a microSDHC memory card which some apps need, maybe another charging cable, wired earbuds or Bluetooth headset ... so plan on total cost of ownership (initial) to be a bit higher- No dedicated hardware button for menu/apps, or for making/ending call; these can be provided by QuickDesk Pro and Headset Button Config apps in the Android Market (e.g. Nokias and other non-smartphone handsets have keypad buttons for calling functions, and launching applications; these phones generally don't have capacitive or touch-screen controls)Other phones to consider: The Samsung Galaxy S II (11/2011), HTC Vivid 4G, HTC Rezound LTE (12/2011), Samsung Galaxy Nexus 4G (12/2011)[Edited: added more information about memory cards.]UPDATE(S):Since buying this phone, I've been through two handsets encountering an annoying cyclical buzzing noise during stereo video recording. The problem develops some times after a reset, after installing some widely used apps. HTC has not confirmed this problem, but I've received anecdotal reports from 2-3 other people also encountering this issue.A common complaint about this phone is a light-bleed from the capacitive soft keys (home, menu, return, search) below the screen. In darkened rooms, the backlights glow from behind the screen, washing it out. Quite annoying when using backgrounds or watching movies. The backlights can be turned off with an app like ScreenFilter, but you shouldn't have to do this for such an expensive phone.I've identified the unusual charge/sync port as HTC's proprietary \"ExtMicro USB\" port. It has 12-pins over Micro-USB's usual 5. Special HTC adapters use the extra leads for video-out, and perhaps other purposes (reference: XDA-developers forums). Though the port is backwards compatible with Micro-USB plugs (for syncing, and for charging), those plugs may wiggle a bit in the phone. Some Amaze owners aren't happy about this. Even less happy about the fact that the T500 cable with this special connector is a) hard to find, and b) not cheap. A call to HTC Customer Service may net you a free one for the asking. If you want to shop for your extra cables, look for an AC-T500 (HTC's part number is 73H00389-11M). The car charger equivalent is called the C500. Andthe 12-pin MHL-HDMI adapter (look for my review there) is the M500.</td><td>List(15, 17)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8349448894331739, 0.16505511056682612))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I am a returning I-Blason customer and have had similar cases for other phones.Pros:-This case is very good because of dual (soft and hard) protection.-Perfect fit (will even fit if using tech armor ballistic glass screen protector).-Holster is of a much better design than similar case for Nexus 5 (you had to glide phone into holster). With this S5 case, you just snap phone into holster and makes it very easy to put phone in or out of the holster.-This case actually looks good!-Adds perfect weight / balance to the S5, which IMHO is too thin.-Little kick-Stand to hold phone in viewing position (for movies on long flights) is a great feature and the stand mechanism is sturdy and phone stays in place.Cons (reason why I take one star off rating):-The clip of the holster is just a bit too long and will remind you that you need to lose these love handles...-The protective matte film on the hard part of the phone case and swivel clip/holster does wear out very quickly and exposes the shinier black plastic. Similar cases for other phones used to do it as well and was reported on many reviews, so it is obvious that I-Blason hasn't taken the reviews into consideration to improve that series of case to make it better.Conclusion: Amazing case for the price.</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5716477442682357, 0.4283522557317643))</td><td>2.0</td><td>I purchased this case as a gift for my Daughter & it does not fit her phone.

I just got my new Samsung Galaxy Note and misplaced the little S-Pen the first night I used it. When I found it I knew it would eventually get lost again because it is very small. The S-Pen has a little plastic tip that is very accurate and does not scratch the screen. However, the two CCM 2 in 1 Stylus + Pens have a \"metal tip\" and write like a regular ink pen. I am not about to use it on my Galaxy Note. However, I did use the rounded rubber end but since it is not tapered to a point, it is less accurate. I'm going to keep them since it would cost more to return them. But make no mistake, they are not exactly a replacement for the original S-Pen.</td><td>List(24, 26)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6405679282340434, 0.35943207176595654))</td><td>3.0</td><td>Doesn't fit as well as I expected, not worth the trouble of a return.

And with that, I've bought every case known to man, from sleep and slim to ultra otter box or beyond.I picked up this case mostly due to my job. Being a paramedic, I'm thrusted into a variety of situations, weather related and all. So I wanted something that could do what otterbox could do, but not be so bulky (since I'm not a fan of holdsters.So I took the risk and bought this case at $80 at Best Buy.I did the water the test, put the iphone in it, and I'm in love. This case looks sharp and feels good and does what it says. I dunked it in water with the iphone in it, dropped it on the floor and even had it thrown by my daughter who loves to grab my expensive gadgets and toss them.Pros: looks great, feels great, does what it says, water proof and all. to check emails and text while taking a shower with it is a little weird, but fun.Cons: a little pricey, charging is a little cumbersome due to the protection, and will need to press down a little harder on the screen due to the plastic covering.Summary: I would buy this again, and not planning on returning it, great buy!</td><td>List(0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.3110342458817768, 0.6889657541182233))</td><td>4.0</td><td>I purchased my lifeproof case from best buy (for $80 ... yet its $100 here? ...). I was quite skeptical as to whether this case met up to all the hype. So I decided I'd give it a try.The first case I bought failed the water test (very concerning). So I went back to best buy and swapped for another one. The second passed and so I proceeded to install it. After installed it's quite a solid lock on the phone.Now for the sound quality...Audio being played (ringtones, music, game sounds, etc) is muffled a little bit. Not so drastic where you have to turn the volume all the way up. I usually have my iPhone at 5 squares (for the ringer)...I had to put it up to 8 squares and its about the same sound. Not a big deal for me. It can be considerably loud if you want it to be. For the earphone...sound quality is maybe a 1 square difference. Almost no difference. I can hear callers perfectly. As for others that call me, I have had no complaints and I did a test call to my house line and sound came through loud and clear.The sound was the biggest concern for me, but it works almost perfectly.The only complaint I have is the screen protector on the front. There is a slight gap from the iPhone screen and the screen protector. So it feels like almost a TFT pressure screen when using the iPhone.Other than my one complaint, the phone is still fully functional with the full protection. I am an active person so now I won't have to worry about water, sand or dust damage.If you want FULL protection from the elements give it a try. You might like, you might not. If you don't, just return it.</td><td>List(2, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8339701497137086, 0.16602985028629136))</td><td>1.0</td><td>I returned this produced it was not what I thought it was going to be.
